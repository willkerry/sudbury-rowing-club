This is the latest iteration of Sudbury Rowing Club’s website.

### It’s made of:

- a data source/CMS: [Sanity.io](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity)
- a frontend framework: [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- a utility-first CSS framework: [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

### It also borrows:

- [bar-of-progress](https://github.com/badrap/bar-of-progress), for lightweight loading bars
- [Headless UI](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui), for accessible and Tailwind-friendly accordions and popovers
- [React Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form), for lightweight form state management
- [next-seo](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo), to limit the pain caused by social media shares
- [Pigeon Maps](https://github.com/mariusandra/pigeon-maps), for mapping components

### For fun, an approximate history of SRC online

**Mid-nineties:** static HTML on a shared domain

**Early-2000s:** static HTML site with table layout and on the rowing.org.uk domain

**2006:** my first foray, a static HTML and CSS site with `float` layout

**2008:** a basic Wordpress install

**2010:** a less basic Wordpress install

**2020:** a custom Wordpress job with all the bells and whistles, which was going to cost an arm and a leg to host

**2021:** this jobbie
