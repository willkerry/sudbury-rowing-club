      <h3>1. Introduction and Purpose</h3>

      <p>
        Sudbury Rowing Club is committed to creating an environment where all
        volunteers are able to perform to their best ability and achieve
        satisfaction. It also recognises that there will be occasions where
        grievances arise.
      </p>

      <p>
        The purpose of this policy is to ensure that if such problems do arise,
        they are dealt with fairly and consistently. This policy sets out the
        action that will be taken when problems occur.
      </p>

      <p>
        The aim of the policy is to encourage improvement in individual conduct
        and performance and to minimise disagreements about disciplinary
        matters, thereby reducing the need for terminating the services of the
        volunteer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where necessary, reference will be made to the policies of British
        Rowing, and in particular document WG 1.7 (Complaints and Disciplinary
        Procedure), which can be accessed here.
      </p>

      <h2>Grievance Procedure</h2>

      <h3>2. Principles</h3>

      <p>
        A fair grievance procedure should address the following key points: Any
        issue should be dealt with promptly and consistently, with the club
        carrying out any necessary investigation in a manner which treats all
        volunteers involved fairly. At every stage the volunteer who is the
        subject of the grievance will be advised of the nature of the complaint
        and given the opportunity to state their case in a formal meeting before
        any decision is taken on whether to impose a warning or other
        disciplinary sanction. The volunteer will be given the opportunity to be
        represented or accompanied at any formal meeting. There is a right to
        appeal against any disciplinary action taken against a volunteer.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Informal Discussions</h3>

      <p>
        Most grievances can be resolved by informal discussions or counselling.
        In the first instance, any grievance should be raised with either the
        relevant Vice Captain, or the Club Welfare Officer, who will attempt to
        resolve the issue informally.
      </p>

      <p>
        If any of these officers are involved in the grievance, or the volunteer
        does not wish to confide in them, they should involve the Captain or the
        Chairman instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the issue cannot be resolved informally, or if it is considered to be
        sufficiently serious, then the formal procedure set out below should be
        followed.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Formal Discussions</h3>

      <p>
        If a volunteer wishes to raise a formal grievance, they must do so in
        writing, addressed to the Chairman, as soon as possible after, but no
        more than one month following the incident which gives rise to the
        complaint.
      </p>

      <p>
        The volunteer must detail the specific circumstances which in their view
        constitute the grievance, giving dates, times and witnesses as
        applicable. This submission must stick to the facts, listing only
        matters which can be substantiated and avoid insulting or abusive
        language.
      </p>

      <p>
        The volunteer will be invited to attend a meeting with the Chairman to
        discuss the grievance, at which they will be entitled to be accompanied
        by a fellow member of the club of their choosing.
      </p>

      <p>
        That member can speak on their behalf, but cannot answer any questions
        put directly to the volunteer, or question any other volunteer present
        at the meeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Chairman may ask another volunteer to attend the meeting to take a
        note of what is said.
      </p>

      <p>The procedure will be as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Chairman opens by reading the grievance, asking the volunteer to
          confirm it is correct, and seek clarification of anything that is
          unclear.
        </li>
        <li>
          The volunteer will have the opportunity to put forward their case and
          say how they would like it to be resolved. They may refer to documents
          or call other volunteers referred to in their grievance as witnesses.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Chairman may ask questions of the volunteer or any witnesses
          called.
        </li>
        <li>
          The volunteer will have the opportunity to summarise their case, but
          not raise new matters.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Chairman will adjourn the meeting to consider the grievance. The
        volunteer who is the subject of the grievance will be contacted, and
        given the same opportunity to hear the grievance, and put forward their
        own case.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he considers it necessary to carry out further investigations, the
        Chairman may call further meetings, either separately, or with all
        parties present.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Chairman will give his decision in writing within one week of any
        final investigatory meeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this procedure fails to satisfy all parties, and bring about the
        desired improvement, then the following formal disciplinary procedure
        will be implemented.
      </p>

      <h2>Disciplinary Procedure</h2>

      <h3>5. Formal Verbal Warning</h3>

      <p>
        If, despite informal or formal discussions, the conduct or performance
        still does not meet acceptable standards, the volunteer may, following
        an appropriate disciplinary meeting, be given a formal verbal warning by
        the Chairman. The volunteer will be told: the reason for the warning
        what the volunteer needs to do to improve the situation a time frame
        within which the conduct or performance needs to be improved any support
        or training that Sudbury Rowing Club might provide to support the
        volunteer that the verbal warning is the first stage of the disciplinary
        procedure A brief note of the warning will be kept but it will lapse
        after 6 months, subject to satisfactory conduct and/or performance.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Written Warning</h3>

      <p>
        If there is no improvement in standards within the prescribed time, or
        if a further offence occurs, the volunteer will receive a letter from
        the Chairman. The letter will contain:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>details of what the volunteer has alleged to have done wrong</li>
        <li>
          the reason why the current behaviour or performance is unacceptable
        </li>
        <li>
          an invitation to attend a disciplinary meeting with the Chairman and
          management representatives at which the problems can be discussed
        </li>
        <li>
          information about the right to be accompanied at the disciplinary
          meeting
        </li>
        <li>
          copies of any documents that will be referred to at the disciplinary
          meeting The disciplinary meeting should take place as soon as is
          reasonably possible but with sufficient time for the volunteer to
          consider their response to the information contained in the letter.
          The meeting will be an opportunity for both the volunteer (with their
          representative) and club representatives to talk about the allegations
          being made, review the information with a view to establishing whether
          to progress the disciplinary action.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Where, following the disciplinary meeting, it is decided that no further
        action is warranted, the volunteer will be informed in writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where, following the disciplinary meeting, the volunteer is found to be
        performing unsatisfactorily or their behaviour is deemed unsatisfactory,
        they will be given a written warning which will set out:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>the performance and/or behaviour problem</li>
        <li>the improvement that is required</li>
        <li>the timescale and date for achieving the improvement</li>
        <li>
          any support that Sudbury Rowing Club will provide to assist the
          volunteer
        </li>
        <li>
          a statement that failure to improve could lead to a final written
          warning and ultimately dismissal
        </li>
        <li>a review date</li>
        <li>the appeal procedure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A copy of the written warning will be kept on file but the warning will
        lapse after 12 months subject to satisfactory conduct and/or
        performance.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Final Written Warning</h3>

      <p>
        If the conduct or performance still remains unsatisfactory by the
        stipulated date, or if the misconduct is sufficiently serious to warrant
        only one written warning, a further disciplinary meeting will be called
        with the volunteer and their representative. The disciplinary meeting
        will be an opportunity for the volunteer to answer the issues raised by
        Sudbury Rowing Club.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where this meeting establishes that there has been a failure to improve
        or change behaviour, then a final written warning will be given to the
        volunteer. The final warning will:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>give details of and the grounds for the complaint</li>
        <li>set out the improvement that is required and a time frame</li>
        <li>
          make it clear that any recurrence of the offence, lack of improvement
          or other serious misconduct within the stipulated period of time will
          result in dismissal
        </li>
        <li>refer to the volunteer’s right of appeal</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A copy of the final written warning will be kept on file but the warning
        will lapse after 12 months subject to satisfactory conduct and/or
        performance.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Dismissal</h3>

      <p>
        If the volunteer’s conduct or performance still fails to improve or if
        further serious misconduct occurs, the final stage in the disciplinary
        process may be instituted and the volunteer dismissed. The decision to
        dismiss will be taken by the management committee following an
        appropriate hearing and the volunteer being given the opportunity to
        state their case and put forward any mitigating circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following the hearing the volunteer will be informed as soon as possible
        as to the outcome and if relevant the reason for the dismissal, the date
        on which the engagement will terminate and the right of appeal.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Gross Misconduct</h3>

      <p>
        Where a volunteer is found guilty of gross misconduct, they will
        normally be subject to summary dismissal and the above procedures
        regarding progression of warnings will not apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where there is an allegation of gross misconduct, a senior member of the
        management committee will carry out an immediate investigation. The
        volunteer will have an opportunity to participate in that investigation
        and put their case and answer the allegations of gross misconduct.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the alleged gross misconduct is being investigated, the volunteer
        may be suspended. Such suspension is not to be regarded as a form of
        disciplinary action and will be for as short a period as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any decision to dismiss will be taken only after an investigation and a
        disciplinary hearing.
      </p>

      <p>
        If, after investigation and disciplinary hearing, it is deemed that the
        volunteer has committed an offence of gross misconduct, the normal
        consequence will be dismissal. The volunteer will be notified of the
        dismissal and appeal process as soon as possible.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        The following list is a non exhaustive list that indicates the type of
        actions that may constitute gross misconduct,
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>theft, fraud, deliberate falsification of club documents</li>
        <li>violent behaviour, fighting, assault on another person</li>
        <li>deliberate damage to club property</li>
        <li>harassment</li>
        <li>being unfit through alcohol or illegal drugs</li>
        <li>gross negligence</li>
        <li>gross insubordination</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>10. Appeals</h3>

      <p>
        If a volunteer wishes to appeal against any disciplinary decision, they
        must appeal, in writing within one week of the decision being
        communicated to them, to the Chairman.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Club Captain will convene an Appeals Sub Committee to hear the
        appeal and the volunteer will be invited to a meeting with the Appeals
        Sub Committee.
      </p>

      <p>
        The volunteer will have the right to be accompanied to the appeal
        meeting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Chairman will not form part of the Appeal Sub Committee and the
        decision of the Appeal Sub Committee will be final.
