    <h2>Crest</h2>
    <p>
      This is a somewhat simplified version of our crest, based on characterful
      twentieth century hand-drawn versions, and intended specifically for use
      on screens. It is a vector graphic, so it can be scaled to any size
      without loss of quality. For other applications (e.g. embroidery),
      completely different versions of the crest are available.

      The club colours, as{" "}

        defined in the constitution

      , are Oxford blue and white. We take heed of the{" "}

      and identify Oxford blue as <strong>Pantone 282</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website’s design system includes {a(toWords(brandColorCount))}
      -step shade graduation based on Pantone 282. This allows us to use
      visually congruent lighter blues in interface design.

    <h2>Fonts</h2>

    <p>The club has no official typeface, but the typefaces used here are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">
          <strong>Inter</strong>
        </a>{" "}
        by Rasmus Andersson, for pretty much everything. It’s a great typeface
        for user interfaces, provided ‘free’ to the world by a very
        well-respected software designer.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/sweet-sans-pro">
          <strong>Sweet Sans Pro</strong>
        </a>{" "}
        by Mark van Bronkhorst, for the logo. This is a commercial typeface,
        licensed only for the logo design. It was chosen for its resemblance to
        the lettering pressed into an early twentieth century set of club
        Christmas cards.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span className="font-bold font-mono">
          <a href="https://jetbrains.com/mono">JetBrains Mono</a>
        </span>
        , for code and monospaced text. This is a free and open-source typeface
        by JetBrains, the makers of some cool developer tools. It was chosen for
        its legibility.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The clubhouse door paint signage (which frequently appears on the
      homepage) is hand-painted each time it is repainted. We use a rough vector
      graphic based on how it appeared in 2018.
    </p>

    <h2>Share images</h2>

    <p>
      We programmatically generate share images for the less-scintillating pages
      on this website. Should you need a generic share image for something, the
      little tool below will generate one for you.
    </p>
