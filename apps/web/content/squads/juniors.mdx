## Mission

As a small (but mighty) rowing club, our mission is to introduce the sport of
rowing to all young people, creating an inclusive and supportive environment
where they can safely discover the joy of being on the water.

Through structured coaching, teamwork, and personal development, our aim is to
help each young athlete not only enjoy rowing but also grow and progress in the
sport -- whether for fun, fitness, or future competition.

## Overview

Sudbury Rowing Club has a vibrant junior squad with capacity for 40 athletes
aged 13 to 18. The squad is split into three groups, allowing every rower to
train at a level that matches their ambitions and commitment.

Whether you're aiming to improve your skills, compete locally, or race at a
national level, there's a place for you to grow and succeed.

We are currently recruiting experienced rowers to our junior squad.
Parents/guardians please
[get in touch with the junior squad vice captain](/contact?q=junior,captain).

## Learn to Row

We run three [Learn to Row courses](/join#l2r) each year, and we aim to coincide
these courses with the school holidays. Before each course, there is an
opportunity to attend a free taster session to see what rowing is all about and
decide if it's the sport for you.

On the learn to row course, you will learn how to scull -- rowing with a blade
in each hand -- and experience the thrill of gliding across the water, building
new skills, and having a blast with new friends. Rowing isn't just a sport --
it's an adventure!

If you would like to be part of the next learn to row course, or to find out
dates for the next intake please ask your parent/guardian to
[get in touch with the junior squad vice captain](/contact?q=junior,captain).
