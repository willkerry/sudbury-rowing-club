## 1. Authorized Feeding Zones

No duck shall be fed outside of designated feeding areas as determined by the
Duck Feeding Committee. Rogue feeding of waterfowl in unauthorized locations is
strictly prohibited.

## 2. Bread Embargo

Members are expressly forbidden from feeding ducks bread products. Only approved
nutritionally appropriate duck feed may be dispensed, as sanctioned by the Duck
Nutrition Subcommittee.

## 3. Quantity Control

No member shall distribute more than the prescribed volume of feed per duck.
Overfeeding is considered a grave breach of duck etiquette and may result in
immediate revocation of duck-feeding privileges.

## 4. Feeding Time Restrictions

Duck feeding shall only occur during officially designated hours. Nocturnal duck
feeding is permitted only with the express written consent of the Head Duck
Warden.

## 5. Crew Coordination

The member leading a duck-feeding expedition shall have full command of the
feeding crew. All duck feed distribution must be conducted with military-like
precision and decorum.

## 6. Equipment Maintenance

All duck-feeding implements — including but not limited to feed containers,
measuring cups, and distribution gloves — shall be cleaned and returned to their
designated storage location immediately following the feeding operation.

## 7. Damage and Disruption

Any member causing undue disturbance to the local duck population or surrounding
environment shall be held personally responsible for any resulting damages or
complaints.

## 8. Emergency Protocols

In the event of an unexpected duck-related incident, the nearest member shall
immediately notify the Duck Incident Response Team and complete a comprehensive
incident report.

## 9. Personal Conduct

Members are reminded that duck feeding is a serious responsibility. Frivolity,
excessive cooing, or inappropriate duck-related behavior will not be tolerated.

## 10. Committee Discretion

The Duck Feeding Committee reserves the right to modify these regulations at any
time, with or without prior notification to the general membership.
