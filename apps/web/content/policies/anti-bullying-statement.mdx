title: Anti-Bullying Statement
postnotes:
  - Updated 2023.
---

The Committee and Officers of Sudbury Rowing Club are committed to providing a
welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for all of our members, both adults
and children.

Bullying of any kind is not tolerated at our club. We take a proactive approach
to prevent bullying of anyone from occurring and will respond to all concerns
and disclosures of bullying, prioritising the well-being of all children and
adults at risk. We believe that in most cases, addressed early on, bullying can
be effectively stopped and everyone can continue to enjoy rowing.

We strongly encourage all members to report incidents of bullying to the Club
Welfare Officer or a member of the Committee to enable us all to work together
to address it.

## Preventing bullying

Our club takes the following preventive measures:

- Our club makes this Anti-Bullying Statement easily available to all members
  and visitors
- Our introduction to new club members and visitors includes outlining our
  anti-bullying stance
- We raise awareness of bullying in our club -- this may be through anti-bullying
  posters; and/or celebrating Anti-Bullying week in November
- All rowers and parents of junior rowers must adhere to and sign the Club's
  Code of Conduct upon joining
- A member who does not adhere to the Code of Conduct may be the subject of the
  club's disciplinary process and ultimately have sanctions applied, such as
  suspension or withdrawal of membership
- Our Club Welfare Officer is responsible for raising awareness of our
  anti-bullying statement and following our procedures (see 'what to do if
  bullying occurs')

### Our Club Welfare Officer has a responsibility to:

- clearly communicate that bullying is not tolerated in the club
- be a contact point for children and adults to speak to about bullying concerns
  and disclosures
- talk to the child or adult to ask them what is happening and what they can do
  to help
- if bullying is taking place, to follow the club's anti-bullying procedures
- talk to the British Rowing Governance and Welfare Team if support is required

## What to do if bullying occurs

- Talk to our Club Welfare Officer (or a Club Committee member if the CWO is not
  available). We cannot promise to keep the bullying secret if we are concerned
  about someone's safety and well-being, but we will do our best to handle all
  concerns and disclosures sensitively, working with you to find practical
  solutions that keep everyone safe and enjoying rowing

### For under 18s:

1. Our Club Welfare Officer will meet with the young person being bullied and
   their parents to agree how to address the bullying. We will make written
   notes after the meeting to summarise what has been said and agreed; these
   will be seen and signed by those present at the meeting

2. If the young person chooses to handle the bullying themselves, ideas for
   doing so will be discussed with the parents and young person unless there are
   concerns that this puts them or someone else at risk of (further) harm

3. If the young person being bullied agrees, or there is a concern that others
   may be at risk of harm, those bullying, and their parents will be asked to
   meet with the Club Welfare Officer. As in (1), notes after the meeting will
   be taken

4. If both parties agree, a meeting between the young person bullying and young
   person being bullied, their parents and Club Welfare Officer, will be held to
   agree how to prevent further bullying and an agreement made and put in
   writing. This is likely to include informing the coach of decisions so that
   the coach can monitor the situation

5. Follow-up meetings will be scheduled (where feasible) to check in on everyone
   involved and ensure the bullying has ceased

6. If the bullying continues, our club may request the bully to leave the club,
   either temporarily or permanently

7. Where there is a concern that the young person bullying may be experiencing
   harm themselves, may be harming others outside of rowing, and/or the bullying
   is severe, our club will report the concerns to the British Rowing Governance
   and Welfare Team, who will work with us in line with the British Rowing
   Safeguarding and Protecting Children Policy

### For over 18s where an adult has identified themselves as 'at risk':

1. Our Club Welfare Officer will meet with the adult being bullied (and their
   carer where there is one and the adult chooses for that person to be present)
   to agree how to address the bullying

2. Steps (2) to (6) above will be followed

3. Where there is a concern that either the bully is a person who may be at risk
   of harm themselves; or the bully may be (at risk of) harming others; or the
   bully is an adult at risk who agrees the issue can be reported so they can
   access support, our club will report the concerns to the British Rowing
   Governance and Welfare Team, who will work with us in line with the British
   Rowing Safeguarding and Protecting Adults at Risk Policy

It is important to remember that the person bullying may be experiencing, or
have experienced bullying, other harm, and/or challenging personal situations
themselves. Our club works with the person bullying and the person being
bullied, with the aim of ending the bullying where both parties can learn from
the incident, become advocates for preventing and responding to bullying and
continue to enjoy rowing. However, in some instances we recognise that the
bullying may not be resolved and/or someone may continue to be at risk of
bullying. Our zero-tolerance approach to bullying means that our club may ask
someone who is bullying to leave the club temporarily or permanently.

### If the person bullying is a coach or other adult in a position of trust:

- If the person bullying is the Club Welfare Officer, concerns should be
  reported to a Committee Member or directly to the British Rowing Governance
  and Welfare Team
- The British Rowing Governance and Welfare Team must always be informed
- Where applicable, the case will follow the British Rowing Disciplinary
  procedures
- The case may be referred to the Case Management Group and/or the police
- Where a coach or teacher is employed by an outside organisation, the British
  Rowing Governance and Welfare Team will also inform the person's employer
