title: Data Protection Policy
---

## What does this policy cover?

Sudbury Rowing Club is committed to protecting your personal data at all times.

This policy outlines the way in which we will address our responsibilities, in
line with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (May
2018).

In particular, the policy will:

- Describe the different types of personal data that we collect about you
- Explain how, and why, we collect and use your personal data
- Explain how long we keep your personal data for
- Outline when, why and with who we share your personal data
- Clarify the legal basis we have for using your personal data
- Describe how we may contact you, and how you can contact us
- Outline the rights you have in relation to your personal data

## What personal data do we collect about you?

We collect contact details that enable us to manage your membership of the club.
This includes your name, address, telephone number and email address.

We may also collect additional personal data, such as age, gender, height,
weight and performance information, so that we can properly manage your
involvement in competitions, under the guidance of British Rowing, the sport's
governing body in the UK.

Where necessary, we may also collect additional sensitive data relating to your
general health. This is to enable us to keep you safe, and to be able to respond
appropriately in the case of an accident or emergency. This data will only be
collected, and used, with your explicit consent.

We may also collect personal contact details for a nominated 'next of kin'. This
information will be used only in the case of an emergency.

## Where do we collect your personal data from?

We collect your personal data from the following sources:

- From you: you will fill out a membership application form, which will ask for
  all of the data that we require. You will also be invited to join 'Squadlist',
  a tool for managing scheduled rowing outings, where additional information may
  be requested
- From a member who nominates you as their next of kin: this information will
  only be used to contact you directly in the case of an emergency

## How long do we keep your personal data for?

We only retain your personal data for as long as you remain a member, in order
to fulfil our requirements as outlined above, or longer, if necessary, to comply
with our legal obligations.

However, with your consent, we may wish to retain a small amount of contact
information, such as an email address, to enable us to contact you with news of
the club's activity in the future.

If you are a commercial contact, or supplier, then we may retain your details
for as long as required for accounting and tax purposes.

Otherwise, your personal data will be securely erased.

In all cases, we will also be guided by the rights and requirements outlined in
the rest of this document.

## Who do we share your personal data with?

We share your data with officers of the club, so that we can manage your
participation in club events. This includes club captains and coaches, as well
as social and safety officers.

If you fulfil a role within the club that requires certification, such as DBS
checks, First Aid, Safeguarding, or coxing/coaching qualifications, then we may
share some of your data with British Rowing, other rowing clubs, statutory
authorities or other certification bodies.

If you wish to compete, then we will share some of your data with British
Rowing, or directly with the organisers of the events you wish to enter.

## What legal basis do we have for using your information?

We use information about members, including past, present and prospective
members, to enable us to provide access to the sport of rowing, in a properly
managed and safe environment.

This includes providing individual support for those new to rowing, and also
support in managing the development of individuals and teams who have already
gained experience.

Regardless of ability, or ambition, we aim to ensure that every member gets the
most from their involvement in the sport.

Where our legitimate interests conflict with your fundamental rights of privacy,
we will endeavour to obtain explicit consent for the use of the information
required.

## How will we contact you?

Our preferred method of communication is by email. If there is some urgency, or
if email communication seems not to be working, then we will contact you by
telephone.

For more formal communication, we may write to you, using the address you
provide to us.

## How can you contact us?

Contact details for the Club, and all of the Club Officers, are publicly
displayed on the club's website, at 'sudburyrowingclub.org.uk'.

As well as addressing specific officers, you may also send an email relating to
Data Protection to 'dpo [at-symbol] sudburyrowingclub.org.uk'.

Note that the club does not currently have a dedicated 'Data Protection
Officer', but this role is currently being fulfilled by the Chair of the club.

## What rights do you have in relation to the data we hold about you?

By law, you have a number of rights over your personal data. Further information
can be obtained from the Information Commissioner's Office, at

### The right to restrict processing

You have the right to request that we stop using your personal data for specific
purposes, even if we continue to hold the data itself.
