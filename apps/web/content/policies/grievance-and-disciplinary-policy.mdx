description:
  This policy describes the processes for addressing grievances and disciplinary
  matters, including informal discussions, formal procedures, and appeals.
---

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

Sudbury Rowing Club is committed to creating an environment where all volunteers
are able to perform to their best ability and achieve satisfaction. It also
recognises that there will be occasions where grievances arise.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that if such problems do arise, they are
dealt with fairly and consistently. This policy sets out the action that will be
taken when problems occur.

The aim of the policy is to encourage improvement in individual conduct and
performance and to minimise disagreements about disciplinary matters, thereby
reducing the need for terminating the services of the volunteer.

Where necessary, reference will be made to the policies of British Rowing, and
in particular document WG 1.7 (Complaints and Disciplinary Procedure), which can
be accessed here.

## 2. Principles

A fair grievance procedure should address the following key points:

- Any issue should be dealt with promptly and consistently, with the club
  carrying out any necessary investigation in a manner which treats all
  volunteers involved fairly
- At every stage the volunteer who is the subject of the grievance will be
  advised of the nature of the complaint and given the opportunity to state
  their case in a formal meeting before any decision is taken on whether to
  impose a warning or other disciplinary sanction
- The volunteer will be given the opportunity to be represented or accompanied
  at any formal meeting
- There is a right to appeal against any disciplinary action taken against a
  volunteer

## 3. Informal Discussions

Most grievances can be resolved by informal discussions or counselling. In the
first instance, any grievance should be raised with either the relevant Vice
Captain, or the Club Welfare Officer, who will attempt to resolve the issue
informally.

If any of these officers are involved in the grievance, or the volunteer does
not wish to confide in them, they should involve the Captain or the Chair
instead.

If the issue cannot be resolved informally, or if it is considered to be
sufficiently serious, then the formal procedure set out below should be
followed.

## 4. Formal Discussions

If a volunteer wishes to raise a formal grievance, they must do so in writing,
addressed to the Chair, as soon as possible after, but no more than one month
following the incident which gives rise to the complaint.

The volunteer must detail the specific circumstances which in their view
constitute the grievance, giving dates, times and witnesses as applicable. This
submission must stick to the facts, listing only matters which can be
substantiated and avoid insulting or abusive language.

The volunteer will be invited to attend a meeting with the Chair to discuss the
grievance, at which they will be entitled to be accompanied by a fellow member
of the club of their choosing.

That member can speak on their behalf, but cannot answer any questions put
directly to the volunteer, or question any other volunteer present at the
meeting.

The Chair may ask another volunteer to attend the meeting to take a note of what
is said.

### Meeting Procedure

1. The Chair opens by reading the grievance, asking the volunteer to confirm it
   is correct, and seek clarification of anything that is unclear
2. The volunteer will have the opportunity to put forward their case and say how
   they would like it to be resolved. They may refer to documents or call other
   volunteers referred to in their grievance as witnesses
3. The Chair may ask questions of the volunteer or any witnesses called
4. The volunteer will have the opportunity to summarise their case, but not
   raise new matters
5. The Chair will adjourn the meeting to consider the grievance. The volunteer
   who is the subject of the grievance will be contacted, and given the same
   opportunity to hear the grievance, and put forward their own case

If he considers it necessary to carry out further investigations, the Chair may
call further meetings, either separately, or with all parties present.

The Chair will give his decision in writing within one week of any final
investigatory meeting.

If this procedure fails to satisfy all parties, and bring about the desired
improvement, then the following formal disciplinary procedure will be
implemented.

## Disciplinary Procedure

### 5. Formal Verbal Warning

If, despite informal or formal discussions, the conduct or performance still
does not meet acceptable standards, the volunteer may, following an appropriate
disciplinary meeting, be given a formal verbal warning by the Chair. The
volunteer will be told:

- The reason for the warning
- What the volunteer needs to do to improve the situation
- A time frame within which the conduct or performance needs to be improved
- Any support or training that Sudbury Rowing Club might provide to support the
  volunteer
- That the verbal warning is the first stage of the disciplinary procedure

A brief note of the warning will be kept but it will lapse after 6 months,
subject to satisfactory conduct and/or performance.

### 6. Written Warning

If there is no improvement in standards within the prescribed time, or if a
further offence occurs, the volunteer will receive a letter from the Chair. The
letter will contain:

- Details of what the volunteer has alleged to have done wrong
- The reason why the current behaviour or performance is unacceptable
- An invitation to attend a disciplinary meeting with the Chair and management
  representatives at which the problems can be discussed
- Information about the right to be accompanied at the disciplinary meeting
- Copies of any documents that will be referred to at the disciplinary meeting

The disciplinary meeting should take place as soon as is reasonably possible but
with sufficient time for the volunteer to consider their response to the
information contained in the letter.

Where, following the disciplinary meeting, it is decided that no further action
is warranted, the volunteer will be informed in writing.

Where, following the disciplinary meeting, the volunteer is found to be
performing unsatisfactorily or their behaviour is deemed unsatisfactory, they
will be given a written warning which will set out:

- The performance and/or behaviour problem
- The improvement that is required
- The timescale and date for achieving the improvement
- Any support that Sudbury Rowing Club will provide to assist the volunteer
- A statement that failure to improve could lead to a final written warning and
  ultimately dismissal
- A review date
- The appeal procedure

A copy of the written warning will be kept on file but the warning will lapse
after 12 months subject to satisfactory conduct and/or performance.

### 7. Final Written Warning

If the conduct or performance still remains unsatisfactory by the stipulated
date, or if the misconduct is sufficiently serious to warrant only one written
warning, a further disciplinary meeting will be called with the volunteer and
their representative.

The final warning will:

- Give details of and the grounds for the complaint
- Set out the improvement that is required and a time frame
- Make it clear that any recurrence of the offence, lack of improvement or other
  serious misconduct within the stipulated period of time will result in
  dismissal
- Refer to the volunteer's right of appeal

A copy of the final written warning will be kept on file but the warning will
lapse after 12 months subject to satisfactory conduct and/or performance.

### 8. Dismissal

If the volunteer's conduct or performance still fails to improve or if further
serious misconduct occurs, the final stage in the disciplinary process may be
instituted and the volunteer dismissed. The decision to dismiss will be taken by
the management committee following an appropriate hearing and the volunteer
being given the opportunity to state their case and put forward any mitigating
circumstances.

### 9. Gross Misconduct

Where a volunteer is found guilty of gross misconduct, they will normally be
subject to summary dismissal and the above procedures regarding progression of
warnings will not apply.

The following list is a non exhaustive list that indicates the type of actions
that may constitute gross misconduct:

- Theft, fraud, deliberate falsification of club documents
- Violent behaviour, fighting, assault on another person
- Deliberate damage to club property
- Harassment
- Being unfit through alcohol or illegal drugs
- Gross negligence
- Gross insubordination

### 10. Appeals

If a volunteer wishes to appeal against any disciplinary decision, they must
appeal, in writing within one week of the decision being communicated to them,
to the Chair.

The Club Captain will convene an Appeals Sub Committee to hear the appeal and
the volunteer will be invited to a meeting with the Appeals Sub Committee.

The volunteer will have the right to be accompanied to the appeal meeting.

The Chair will not form part of the Appeal Sub Committee and the decision of the
Appeal Sub Committee will be final.
