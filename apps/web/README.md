This is the latest iteration of Sudbury Rowing Club’s website.

### It’s made of:

- a data source/CMS: [Sanity.io](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity)
- a frontend framework: [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- some headless component primitives: [Radix UI](https://github.com/radix-ui/radix-ui)
- a utility-first CSS framework: [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

### For fun, an approximate history of SRC online

**Mid-nineties:** static HTML on a shared domain

**Early-2000s:** static HTML site with table layout and on the rowing.org.uk domain

**2006:** my first foray, a static HTML and CSS site with `float` layout

**2008:** a basic Wordpress install

**2010:** a less basic Wordpress install

**2020:** a custom Wordpress job with all the bells and whistles, which was going to cost an arm and a leg to host

**2021:** this jobbie
