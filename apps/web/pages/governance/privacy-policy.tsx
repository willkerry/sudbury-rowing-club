    <h3>What does this policy cover?</h3>
    <p>
      Sudbury Rowing Club is committed to protecting your personal data at all
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      This policy outlines the way in which we will address our
      responsibilities, in line with the requirements of the General Data
      Protection Regulations (May 2018).
    </p>
    <p>In particular, the policy will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Describe the different types of personal data that we collect about you.
      </li>
      <li>Explain how, and why, we collect and use your personal data.</li>
      <li>Explain how long we keep your personal data for.</li>
      <li>Outline when, why and with who we share your personal data.</li>
      <li>Clarify the legal basis we have for using your personal data.</li>
      <li>Describe how we may contact you, and how you can contact us.</li>
      <li>Outline the rights you have in relation to your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What personal data do we collect about you?</h3>
    <p>
      We collect contact details that enable us to manage your membership of the
      club. This includes your name, address, telephone number and email
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also collect additional personal data, such as age, gender, height,
      weight and performance information, so that we can properly manage your
      involvement in competitions, under the guidance of British Rowing, the
      sport&#8217;s governing body in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where necessary, we may also collect additional sensitive data relating to
      your general health. This is to enable us to keep you safe, and to be able
      to respond appropriately in the case of an accident or emergency. This
      data will only be collected, and used, with your explicit consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also collect personal contact details for a nominated ‘next of
      kin’. This information will be used only in the case of an emergency.
    </p>
    <h3>Where do we collect your personal data from?</h3>
    <p>We collect your personal data from the following sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        From you: you will fill out a membership application form, which will
        ask for all of the data that we require. You will also be invited to
        join ‘Squadlist’, a tool for managing scheduled rowing outings, where
        additional information may be requested.
      </li>
      <li>
        From a member who nominates you as their next of kin: this information
        will only be used to contact you directly in the case of an emergency.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How long do we keep your personal data for?</h3>
    <p>
      We only retain your personal data for as long as you remain a member, in
      order to fulfil our requirements as outlined above, or longer, if
      necessary, to comply with our legal obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, with your consent, we may wish to retain a small amount of
      contact information, such as an email address, to enable us to contact you
      with news of the club&#8217;s activity in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a commercial contact, or supplier, then we may may retain your
      details for as long as required for accounting and tax purposes.
    </p>
    <p>Otherwise, your personal data will be securely erased.</p>
    <p>
      In all cases, we will also be guided by the rights and requirements
      outlined in the rest of this document.
    </p>
    <h3>Who do we share your personal data with?</h3>
    <p>
      We share your data with officers of the club, so that we can manage your
      participation in club events. This includes club captains and coaches, as
      well as social and safety officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you fulfil a role within the club that requires certification, such as
      DBS checks, First Aid, Safeguarding, or coxing/coaching qualifications,
      then we may share some of your data with British Rowing, other rowing
      clubs, statutory authorities or other certification bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to compete, then we will share some of your data with British
      Rowing, or directly with the organisers of the events you wish to enter.
    </p>
    <h3>What legal basis do we have for using your information?</h3>
    <p>
      We use information about members, including past, present and prospective
      members, to enable us to provide access to the sport of rowing, in a
      properly managed and safe environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This includes providing individual support for those new to rowing, and
      also support in managing the development of individuals and teams who have
      already gained experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of ability, or ambition, we aim to ensure that every member
      gets the most from their involvement in the sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where our legitimate interests conflict with your fundamental rights of
      privacy, we will endeavour to obtain explicit consent for the use of the
      information required.
    </p>
    <h3>How will we contact you?</h3>
    <p>
      Our preferred method of communication is by email. If there is some
      urgency, or if email communication seems not to be working, then we will
      contact you by telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more formal communication, we may write to you, using the address you
      provide to us.
    </p>
    <h3>How can you contact us?</h3>
    <p>
      Contact details for the Club, and all of the Club Officers, are publicly
      displayed on the club’s website, at ‘sudburyrowingclub.org.uk’.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as addressing specific officers, you may also send an email
      relating to Data Protection to ‘dpo [at–symbol] sudburyrowingclub.org.uk’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the club does not currently have a dedicated ‘Data Protection
      Officer’, but this role is currently being fulfilled by the Chair of the
      club.
    </p>
    <h3>What rights do you have in relation to the data we hold about you ?</h3>
    <p>
      By law, you have a number of rights over your personal data. Further

    <Note label="October 2023 update on analytics">
      We now run a self-hosted instance of the privacy-focussed analytics tool,{" "}
      <a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics">Plausible</a>, to collect
      anonymised usage statistics of the types described above.
      <p>
        The Plausible tool does not use cookies, so it cannot track visitors
        over extended periods of time or between websites. Visitors are
        identified by an anonymised hash composed of a randomly-generated daily
        salt, the website domain, the visitor’s IP address, and their user agent
        string. It is impossible to ’unbake’ the hash to identify its component
        parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Plausible instance is hosted on the EU-based cloud provider{" "}
        <a href="https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/">OVH SAS</a>. Your data are
        stored on databases that we control on OVH hardware in France, and are
        not shared with any third parties (inluding Plausible).
