Peterborough Regatta, held over the weekend of the 1st and 2nd of June saw Sudbury Juniors competing on Saturday.

Amelia Moule won the Women’s Junior 18 single sculls, equalling the course record with a time of 4:01. Byron Bullen and Sam McLoughlin won the Junior 18 double sculls event, breaking the course record with a time of 3:21. A tremendous achievement for Amelia, Byron and Sam.

Both Bullen and McLoughlin gained places in the final of the J18 single sculls event, with Bullen finishing second in 3:40 and McLoughlin finishing third in 3:46. Fergus Grant and Harry Moule competed in the J15 double through two heats to get into the final, where they finished second in a time of 3:38, less than 3 seconds behind the winner.

In the J14 singles, H Moule went on to win his heat, finishing second in the final in a time of 3:55, only 4 seconds behind the winner, with Grant finishing third in 4:08 in the J15 singles semi final. More good performances were seen by Amelia Maskell and Helena Griffiths in the Women’s double sculls band 1, coming second with a time of 4:05. Maskell also raced in the Women’s single sculls event, finishing 3rd in a time of 4:27.

The Women’s Junior 15 coxed quad of Amelia Moule (cox); Grace Power; Evie Prager; Emilie Larkin and Amy Wallace raced well, but didn’t make the finals on this occasion. WJ15 double sculls Evie Prager; Emilie Larkin and Amy Wallace; Grace Power also raced well, just missing their finals this time.

It was the turn of the the Sudbury Adult squad on Sunday. The day was sunny, but with quite windy conditions, however it was blowing straight down the course giving the rowers a nice tailwind.

Sophie Brown was the first to race that day. Sadly her opposition did not race but Sophie made good use of the tail wind and gave a great performance. The Women's MasE double scull of Tracy Muir and Teresa Moriarty also made the most of the tail wind, achieving a time of 4:28 and the MasF double of Jeremy Millbank and Sean Moriarty took an interesting racing line across several lanes to finish 4th in a time of 4:17. The Women's MasD double of Jen Ward and Sophie Lovegrove gave it their all, achieving a time of 4:19 in their heat.

The Men’s MasC pair of Mark Tyrie and Pete Donovan held up very well against a now choppy stretch of water and finished in a time of 4:02, which qualified them for the final. Their next race wasn’t so fortunate as they suddenly capsized at the 500m line, due to the technical fault of not securing a blade in a gate! They managed to climb back in and row to the finish. They achieved second place in their last row of the day with a time of 4:02.

In the Women’s MasE single sculls Sarah Watts raced in horrible windy conditions, that made the water extremely choppy, however she achieved third place in a time of 4:46.

The Mixed MasB double of Tim Wallace and Poppy Grosch, who entered the open category earlier in the day, the only mixed crew against all male crews, finished in a time of 4:04 which secured them a place in the final. In very challenging conditions against experienced crews, they came second with a time of 3:56, to the winners, an RAF crew who had the loudest supporters of the day…….THE RED ARROWS!!!!
