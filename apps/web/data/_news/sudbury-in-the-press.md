In the run up to this year’s regatta, the club has warranted many a radio, magazine and newspaper appearance. First, a _Rowing & Regatta_ cover story, then another in *Suffolk and Norfolk Life* (by our own Pippa Kerry), and now the grand appearance of the inimitable Messrs Blit and Arnott, Ellie and Pippa on BBC Radio Suffolk.

We may still be bereft of straw bales; the meadow may be slightly boggy; the clouds may be more than a little grey, but this regatta is the culmination of a-hundred-and-thirty-one years of practice and is set to be our very finest.
