The UK Government recently released ‘Guidance for the public on the phased return of outdoor sport and recreation’ and this sets out more detailed information, specific for the sports sector, and building on the Government’s COVID-19 recovery strategy.

The Government permits sports clubs to re-open for physical and mental well-being provided social distancing is adhered to and steps are taken to prevent any possible transference of COVID-19.

Following guidance from our governing body British Rowing, Sudbury Rowing Club is planning to re-open the Club to its members from Tuesday 26 May. Single sculling will be permitted, with no more than 2 members at the Club or on the water at any one time. For members of the same household pairs/doubles are also permitted, subject to no other club members being present.

Measures have been put in place for social distancing, sanitisation before and after outings and for thorough cleansing of boats/ancillary equipment and any touch points necessary to gain access to the grounds.

If you require any further information regarding this matter, please contact the chairman.
