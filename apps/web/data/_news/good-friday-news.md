Sudbury juniors Martha Bullen and Amelia Maskell will be representing the Eastern Region at the Inter-Regional Championships later this month in Nottingham. Their previous results were used in the selection process and they will compete in the girls Under 16 double sculls category.

Six members of Sudbury Rowing Club completed the Sudbury Fun Run before attending the Rowing Club Good Friday Opening. Club Captain Sean Moriarty led the way, followed by Sam McLoughlin, Amelia Moule, Byron Bullen, Martha Bullen and Amelia Maskell.

They then joined other club members at the Rowing Club to celebrate the official start of the season and competed in some very exciting races along Friars Meadow.

Back at the Clubhouse the Deputy Mayor raised the flag, Club Chairman Stephen Nichols gave an inspiring pre-season speech before Easter Egg prizes were presented to the winning crews and Hot Cross Buns were enjoyed!

The next event will be Bedford Small Boats Head.
