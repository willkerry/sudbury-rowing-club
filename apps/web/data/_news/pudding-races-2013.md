[![thumb](/assets/news/images/thumb-300x212.png)](http://sudburyrowingclub.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SRCposter.pdf)The annual Pudding Races are taking place this Saturday (21 December 2013) and competitors should get to the club at 8:30 AM, ready in fancy dress.

Don't forget that, this year, the committee has voted to introduce a race fee of £1 per seat.

There'll be a raffle, in which the top prize is a signed and worn pair of James Cracknell's rowing shorts, there'll be cakes, there'll be beer, mulled wine, mince pies and just about anything else you could reasonably wish for.

Cake donations are welcome.

Now, let's dig out those red bobble hats.
