The Women's Double Scull of Bev Goodchild (Ipswich RC) and Jen Titterington raced at Nottingham City Regatta at the weekend, over 2000m.

On a windy day, and in the elite 'Women's Band 1' category, they were beaten by local opposition from Nottingham Rowing Club, but recorded a personal best time in the process.

Later in the day, and in significantly more challenging conditions, they raced again in the Open Women's Double Sculls event, and after a decisive first half were able to survive the rolling waves to record another win.
