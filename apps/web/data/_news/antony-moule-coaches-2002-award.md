Further confirming the club's status as a strong junior club in the region, Antony Moule was put forward for the ARA's [Coaches of 2002](http://www.ara-rowing.org/news/021209_ARAcoach.php) award. For those who can't be bothered to click on the link, the citation reads

> 'The standard of nominations was so exceptional that a further five were highly commended for their contribution to the sport'

I'm sure we all recognise Tony's efforts both with the school and with Peter, Sam and Dawn, so a belated but very fitting mention. Well done!

#### A full round up of Tony's many achievements

At Sudbury Rowing Club's Christmas Dinner on Friday 13 December, an unexpected guest arrived. No, not Santa Claus but Mike Mansfield, Chairman of the Eastern Region Rowing Council, part of the Amateur Rowing Association. However, he was bearing a 'gift' for one unsuspecting member of the club - Junior Coach Antony Moule. Antony was presented with the Regional Coaching Award for his work with the juniors of the Club, and also had his name put forward for the National Award. He narrowly missed out on this, gaining a letter of commendation for all his efforts. These are the first awards of their kind, the ARA having instigated the coaching award scheme this year.

Antony Moule has coached juniors at Sudbury RC for more than five years now, and has consistently seen potential in youngsters that come to the club. By giving unstintingly of his skill, patience, knowledge, personality and most of all his time, he has produced at local, national and international level results, never seen before for this club. Between 1998 and 2002 Antony has coached a number of juniors including Peter Gostling, Laura McGrillen, Aaron Hogsbjerg, Sam Dixon and Dawn Frost. Between them these young people achieved over 40 wins in head races and regattas, with three of them winning pennants at the Scullers Head of the River in the past 4 years. They have competed in regional and national trials, and have represented the East of England and Great Britain.

Peter Gostling represented Great Britain in the GB-France international in 1999 and in the Coupe de la Jeunesse in 2001, with Sam Dixon representing Great Britain in the Coupe de la Jeunesse in 2002. Both boys competed in the Fawley cup at Henley Royal Regatta, Peter being the first member of the club ever to compete at Henley. He has since gone on to row for Leander, winning two Henley medals as well as Golds at National Schools and National Championship regattas.

Antony's commitment to the juniors does not end when they come off the water. In addition, he sets up land based training schedules, and offers them help and support every step of the way. Antony is responsible for enabling the juniors to compete at suitable Regattas or to attend trials and training camps, and ensures that both competitors & boats arrive safely. He gives freely of his time, often driving the juniors to different venues across the country, despite having a wife and small daughter at home.

In Autumn 2001, under the auspices of the ARA's Go-Row scheme, Antony started up a rowing club at Sudbury Upper School. Following Dry-Start activities in the winter and spring terms they progressed on to the water in the summer. He now continues his weekly sessions with a new year-group at the school.

Sudbury Rowing Club is immensely proud of all that Antony has achieved.
