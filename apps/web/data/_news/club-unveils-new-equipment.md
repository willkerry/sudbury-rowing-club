Sudbury Councillors attended Sudbury Rowing Club on Saturday for the presentation of some new equipment which they helped to fund.

Colin Spence assisted with funds from his Suffolk County Council locality budget towards a new boat rack, John Sayers and Richard Kemp jointly assisted with the locality budgets towards a new set of rowing blades specifically for the junior and ladies squads.

The new equipment is essential for the development of the club as it has seen numbers steadily increase, especially in the Junior Squad.

Although there is regular interest from people who have little or no knowledge of rowing and want to learn to row, the Club is also looking for ex-rowers who might be keen to come back to the sport - sculling or rowing, crew boats or singles - there is something on offer for everyone!

Please contact the Club Captain by email captain@sudburyrowingclub.org.uk for any further information.
