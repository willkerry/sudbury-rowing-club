    "description": "The Sudbury Regatta takes place on the first Saturday of August each year.\n\n The 650m Rowing course is raced upstream from a stake boat start along a course characterised by some challenging bends. One of the highlights of the regatta is the sprint eights event, racing for hip-flasks along the last and straighter 350m.\n\n We provide state of the art spectator facilities, particularly in the stadium section of the course with wonderful home-baked cakes, burgers, a hog roast, ice cream and locally brewed beer.\n\n The official event photographer is [Bill Hiskett](https://www.hiskett.net/). His photographs may be used on the website and social media sites of the Regatta and its Organising Committee. Official photographs will also be available for sale from [Bill’s website](https://www.hiskett.net/) after the event.
