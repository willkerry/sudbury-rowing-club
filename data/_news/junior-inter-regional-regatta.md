Sudbury has had 3 of its junior squad chosen to represent the Eastern region in this years JIRR, to be held at Nottingham on Saturday 26th April.

Nick Scott will be rowing in the J14 single category, after finishing joint first with a rower from Star Club at trials; he rowed against him again at Peterborough and comfortably won by 17 seconds, securing his place in the team.

Ellie Adams, who came second in trials in the WJ16 singles thought her chance of racing was over, however after a coach from Hollowell decided to make up a composite WJ16 8, along with 5 other club rowers who were unsuccessful at trials the race was back on. Sudburyâ€™s Molly Shaw was chosen to cox the crew and after just one outing they had to race at Bedford Head against the other crew wanting the place from Bedford Girls School.

The race took place over the 2k course at Bedford and it resulted in a dead heat, meaning with just less than 2 weeks to the JIRR finals another race had to take place. So on Good Friday with yet another change in the composite 8, due to holiday commitments, 3 new members joined the crew for a training session at Cambridge, then straight over to Peterborough to race against Bedford Girls over 1k side-by-side.

As the race started BGS had a strong start, although the Composite 8 had been warned that this was likely, and after BGS pulled away by half a length they could take no more, after 250m the Composite 8 started to close the gap, BGS went for another push but made no impact, by 500m the crews were pretty much level and then the Composite 8 started to pull away from BGS. With approx 100m to go the Composite 8 pushed past the bows of the BGS boat and managed to get clear water. A fantastic race to watch and secured their place at Nottingham on Saturday.

Good luck to all of them!
