Sudbury Rowing Club's Men's Masters entered the Veterans Head of the River Race from Mortlake to Putney Bridge, over 4 miles. The crew of Lee Adams, Paul Adams, Robin King, Tim Hysom, Keith Paxman, Mark Tyrie, Stephen Nichols, Paul Spencer and cox Lucy Keedy-Davies started 75th and raced the course along with 220 other crews from both the UK and around the world. They finished in a respectable 62nd place and 10th out of 28 in their age category.

With the winter head racing drawing to a conclusion the club will now start to focus on the summer regatta season. The traditional Easter Opening on Good Friday is the formal start of the regatta season - scratch crews will be competing in sprint races to win Easter Eggs and the Town Mayor will raise the club flag. New and old members are invited to attend the Easter festivities. Racing will start at approx. 9.00am with the flag being raised at about 11.30am.

The club are always keen to welcome both new and experienced rowers into the club and details can be found on the club website at [www.sudburyrowingclub.org.uk](http://sudburyrowingclub.org.uk).
