A number of Sudbury Rowing Club members were due to compete at the Alton Head on Saturday but due to adverse weather conditions, the race was postponed. Crews decided to organise their own Head to Head race on the Stour instead, and were joined by members of Essex University Rowing Club who also competed in the 2000 metre race.

This proved to be a useful training exercise in tricky rowing conditions. Out of sixteen crews, the fastest on the day was a mens eight from the University of Essex - coxed by Sudbury's Amelia Moule - who completed the course in 6 minutes 48 seconds.

The following day, two crews attended the Star Head in Bedford. With improved weather conditions, the 2000 metre course was rowed by Ellie Adams in the Womens IM3 single sculls event. Out of four competitors in the catagory, Adams finished in second place in a time of 8 minutes 43 seconds.

Also competing was the Masters C coxed four of Paul Adams, Lee Adams, Mark Tyrie, Jason Pryke and Helen Sharp (cox) who went on to win their event in a time of 7 minutes 19 seconds, beating two other crews in their category.

Sudbury's next event will be the Scullers Head on the Thames at the beginning of December.
