Sudbury Rowing Club had six junior members travel to the London Olympic Velodrome to compete at the British Rowing Indoor Championships.

They competed in different age groups, some completing a set distance of 2000 metres and the younger members took part in a 3, 4, 5 or 6 minute challenge.

Byron Bullen competed in the Sixth Form Boys 2000 metres, finishing in 7 minutes 13 seconds.

Amelia Moule competed in the Sixth Form Girls 2000 metres. She finished in a Personal Best time of 8 minutes 12 seconds.

Martha Bullen competed in the Girls Year 10 - 5 minutes category. She completed 1315m (PB) and finished seventh in her group.

Sam McLoughlin competed in the Boys Year 11 - 6 minutes category. He achieved a distance of 1646m (PB).

Harry Moule raced in the Boys Year 8 - 3 minute category, finishing 7th in his category, clocking up 790m, another PB.

Owen Moriarty raced in the Boys Year 10 - 5 minute category. He completed a distance of 1210m (PB).

The juniors had an enjoyable day, mixing with rowers from clubs all over the country and meeting GB rowers, who were also competing.

Back on home turf, Sudbury Rowing Club held their annual Pudding Races.

Members of all ages and abilities joined together and made up scratch crews in eights, quads, doubles and singles to race the length of Friars Meadow, and successful crews won Christmas Puddings!

Prizes were also given out for the best fancy dress outfits. Festivities carried on in the clubhouse with mulled wine and mince pies.

Training continues over the Christmas period and the first event of 2018 will be Bedford Star Head Race on 14th January.
