This mail is to let those of your who had entered St Neots Regatta know that the summer weather has hit yet another event and it has had to be cancelled with a week to go.

It gives us time to continue to train and redouble our efforts to enter and do well at the remaining events of the summer – Sudbury International, Peterborough Summer, Cambridge Autumn and of course the longer events at Ely and Boston.

This is also advance notice that we shall be having a Maintenance Day on Saturday 28 July to prepare for our Regatta and to undertake some simple but needed maintenance on our boats and equipment.

Happy training,

Keith
