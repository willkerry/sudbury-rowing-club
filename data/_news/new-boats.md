We have ordered a second virus boat to support our beginner’s programme, plus some new blades to go with it. It should be delivered before the end of June. We have also placed an order for a new bank tub. The tub will be fixed to the landing stage enabling the rower to practice rowing in a stable vessel that doesn’t move. This investment will be very useful in speeding up the learning process for beginners, but also useful to refine/break the bad habits, of the more experienced rowers. We hope to have this in June too.

Iris course: With the recent ROSE course completed, the next course will be intermediate Rowing in Sudbury (IRIS) This is scheduled to run for 6 consecutive Sundays beginning the 5th September. Contact the captain if you want to go on the list.
