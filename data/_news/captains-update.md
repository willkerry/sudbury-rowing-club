The end of the winter season is approaching with the landmark of the Head of the River Races. Our thoughts will soon turn from icy mornings to warm sun, light evenings and the Regatta season.

This update looks back at the last couple of months and ahead towards Easter and beyond.

Can you please read carefully the various topics below as some may require you to take action or perhaps volunteer.

# Recent Events

### Bedford Star Head Sunday 22 January

This Head was rearranged after being cancelled before Christmas due to fog. On this occasion the weather was much more friendly and we fielded a cross section of crews from the club.

#### Wins went to:

- Masters B 4+ - Paul Sant, Charles Howard, Lee Adams, Paul Adams, Ellie Adams
- Masters E Pair - Mike Arnott, Andrew Blit
- WJ14 Double - Amy Bowles, Ellie Adams
- WJ14 Single - Ellie Adams

Lee Adams and Rob Frost and Dan Rhodes and Bradley Tyler also put in good times but unfortunately had no opposition on the day and the rest of the SRC entrants all competed well without a win on this occasion. A great turn out and some excellent racing.

### Peterborough Head 4 February – unfortunately cancelled due to ice

### Norwich Head 25 February

Another pleasant day with a choice of 2k and 5K distances in two Divisions. We put in some good performances reflecting the high level of training over recent weeks; but we also found some strong opposition.

A win for WJ 14 Double Amy Bowles and Ellie Adams over the 2k course

### Ladies HORR

Katherine Insull represented the club after being selected for the Eastern Region U18 ladies composite crew. With only one outing and after having to find a replacement boat just before launching they came 81 out of 287 with Katherine in stroke position

### Hammersmith Head Sunday 4 March

The Men’s 8+ entered this high quality field and posted a really good result of 10out of 17. Significantly it included beating the Lea 8+ again a reflection of the level of training.

## Boats and Racking

The Jack Spurgeon has returned from refurbishment and looks as good as new and we have taken delivery of a Heavyweight Pair which means some of the men’s squad now have a boat that they can train and compete in. We also have a new rack which eases our racking problems and allows some additional private boat racking too. Thanks to Tony Moule for arranging and delivering.

## Squads

### Junior Squad

With Rob as VC and Matt as Coach the junior squad continues to train hard and compete well. Katherine and Bradley have been attending Regional training and Katherine recently was well placed in the U18 Trials and awaits the next opportunity.

George, Molly, Amy and Ellie recently attended the Junior Inter Regional Trials at a rather cold and wet Peterborough. George and Molly both did really well in their age groups and Amy and Ellie won their group by 50 seconds.

### Ladies Squad

Pippa and Rosemary and Tanya with Jeremy in a mixed pair are focussed on their training for the Boston Head. Appropriately on 1 April the event is 31 miles from Lincoln to Boston. Good luck to both crews.

Other members of the squad are training regularly at weekends and also a new Thursday morning session being lead by Mike and Pippa (new recruits to this session are welcome whether female or male)

### Men’s Squad

After perhaps the most intensive winter training for many years the men’s squad is looking for some good results at the HORR on 17 March and the Vets HORR on 18March. In recent weeks the crews have been training at Ardleigh reservoir which offers some (mainly) ice free conditions and longer non-stop rowing than our own river.

In addition to both these crews four of the squad are also forming a composite crew with Essex University. So we will be filling 20 HORR seats over the two days supported by Ellie and Molly as coxes.

We shall be arranging a meeting for all squad members in the next couple of weeks to agree our aims and objectives for the Regatta season ahead. Look out for details.

## Open Days and Learn to Row

We have a significant wait list of potential members and we need some new blood in our squads. So we are planning open days on 25 March and 1 April. This will be followed by parallel Learn to Row courses for Juniors and Adults starting 22 April for 6 weeks. These days and courses need some intensive input from coaches and members so when details are finalised volunteers to help make them a success will be very welcome from all members whatever age or capability.

## Easter Opening

As usual our Easter Opening will be on Good Friday 6 April. The usual scratch crew Egg Races will be followed by the formal opening and beer and other drinks and hot cross buns. More details will follow soon but mark it in your diary.

## And Finally a Request

The Rowing Committee comprises, me, the Vice-Captains – Tricia M, Katherine C, Sam H, Rob F; Mike A representing the coaches and Ellie A representing the coxes and we try to ensure that we are totally inclusive and consider all club members in our plans. If you feel that you as an individual or a group have been overlooked or not considered then please raise it with any one of us – we will do our best to cater for your needs. We cannot get it right all of the time but we do try.

Happy Rowing,

**Keith Paxman**
