Sudbury Rowing Club attended the Norwich Head last weekend.

The last race before the Head of the River Races this month, eights and fours raced over a 5000 metre course and scullers and juniors raced over 2000 metres.

Sudbury had three ladies eights racing and two men's eights, gaining good distance experience for the upcoming races on the Thames.

Winning crews at Norwich were Mike Arnott, winner of masters G single sculls and Callum Power who was the winner of Junior 18 single sculls.

Martha Bullen came second in her event (junior 14 single sculls) and managed to qualify to represent the East of England in the Inter-Regional Championships.

Also taking part in the East of England Junior Trials were Amelia Moule and Nell Belcher in the junior 16 doubles who finished second in their category, just losing out to Kings School Ely. Amelia Maskell and Lily Blair-Slater raced in the same event.

Sam McLoughlin, Byron Bullen, Morgan Moriarty and Lucy Keedy-Davies all competed in single sculls as did young sculler Owen Moriarty in his debut race, competing in the junior 14 single sculls event.

The junior coxed four of Callum Power, Morgan Moriarty, Byron Bullen, Henry Tullin and Amelia Moule (cox) also competed the long distance course and used the raced to gain experience for the Schools Head of the River Race which takes part on the Thames, also this month.

Two ladies eights from Sudbury will be travelling to London next weekend to race in the Women's Head of the River Race along with over 300 other crews from all over the UK, as well as crews travelling from Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
