Sudbury Rowing Club took one of its largest crews to Bedford, with 21 crews entered across the five divisions, racing the 2000m course.

With strong winds and heavy rain making conditions difficult it was still pleasing to come away with 7 wins.

In the junior crews the J13 double of Alanah Barton and Georgia Howard put in a strong show for their first win together. William Kerry and George Cook in the J14 double rowed very well, and took a well-earned victory over their competition from six other crews.

Bronwen King and Holly Adams in the J16 double worked well together and secured yet another victory as their pairing.

Several junior crews racing in their first competition provided some pleasing results with quite a few second places throughout the day.

The adult crews weren’t going to be out done. Mike Arnott and Rosemary Hogsbjerg won in the Mixed Veterans double, and later Mike also secured victory in the Men’s Veteran Sculls.

The men’s Novice 4 of Jeremy Milbank, Paul Adams, StJohn Gardner and Lee Adams coxed by Tricia McGrillan, in their first outing together, also took victory providing further crew options for the future.

Paul Hamblett in the Elite sculls brought home the final win of the day, adding to his growing list of wins.

The ladies crews also showed grit and determination, providing them with the opportunity to test out different crew combinations. With a growing amount of racing crews, this also allowed the young coxes Sudbury has to gain invaluable experience for future races.

Good to see the return of Aaron Hogsbjerg, racing in a single scull for the first time in eight years, securing a second place.

The clubs target of 40 wins for the 2009/2010 season already stands at 14!
