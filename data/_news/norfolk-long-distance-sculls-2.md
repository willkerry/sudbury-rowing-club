Sudbury Rowing Club have had a busy October with some very wet but successful racing.

First was the Pairs Head of the River race covering 4500 metres of the Thames, where overall 400 crews competed from all over the country. Three Sudbury crews competed in heavy rain and blustery conditions.

Byron Bullen and Sam McLoughlin raced in the Men’s Junior 18 Intermediate event, Amelia Moule and Amelia Maskell raced in the Women’s Junior 18 Intermediate event and Jen Titterington and Bev Goodchild (Ipswich RC) raced in the Women’s Championship Doubles. All three crews raced well in their categories.

The next event was Bedford Small Boats Head - a distance of 2000 metres with some bridges to avoid. Another very wet day of racing with some crews racing in three different divisions and in different events.

Winning crews were:- Harry Moule in the Junior 15 single sculls event, Women’s Band 2 quad of Amelia Moule, Helena Griffiths, Amelia Maskell and Martha Bullen. Jen Titterington won the Women’s Band 1 single sculls event and also raced in a composite quad with Ipswich and Lea RC, winning their event. Martha Bullen won the Women’s Junior 16 single sculls.

The most recent win was at the Norfolk Long Distance Sculls in Norwich where Mike Arnott, Andrew Blit, Keith Paxman and Brendan Sullivan (above) were fastest in their category, Masters E-G 4x, coming away with a win. This crew will be competing at the Fours Head of the River race on the Thames next weekend.
