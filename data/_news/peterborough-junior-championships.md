Three members of the Sudbury Rowing Club Junior Squad attended the Peterborough Junior Championships at the weekend. The racing distance was 1000 metres on the four lane course.

First to race was Martha Bullen in the Junior 13 single sculls event. In the heat Martha finished in second place in a time of 4.46 which secured her a place in the semi final. Martha had a better race in the semi final improving her time by 7 seconds but eventually finished in third place, just missing out on a place in the final.

Amelia Moule was hoping to continue with her recent success competing in the Junior 15 single sculls event. In the fastest out of three heats a sculler from Isle of Ely was the clear winner with Amelia and a sculler from Yarm School battling it out for second place and a place in the repechage. An excellent race unfolded and both scullers gave 100 percent effort with just inches between them at the finish. Unfortunately, Moule was declared the third place finisher in a time of 4.23 and just missed out on a place in the next round. Isle of Ely and Yarm School were the eventual gold and silver medallists in this event.

The only medal of the day came from Junior 14 Single sculler Sam McLoughlin. Again there was a clear winner of the heat from Rob Roy RC, but again second and third place was extremely close and every ounce of effort and determination was used. The verdict went to McLoughlin in a time of 3.58 and he secured himself a place in the final. The Rob Roy sculler took the gold medal, followed by Hereford in the silver medal position, closely followed by Sudbury who took the bronze medal in a time of 4.28.

Training will continue in the coming weeks for the next event which is a two day event in St. Neots.

Sudbury Regatta takes place on Saturday 6th August.
