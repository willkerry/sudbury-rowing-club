### Saturday 22 December (0830-1230)

Don Christmas hats and plenty of layers this December before bundling the in-laws up to the club for a morning of friendly (yet intensely competitive) racing in scratch crews. As usual, the winning team will be awarded with puddings and all are welcomed to the clubhouse for a feast of mince pies, mulled wine, jacket potatoes and cake, all washed down with a festive punch.

Let Emma or Jeanette know that you'll be attending so that sufficient food can be prepared and then declare your availability on Squadlist so that approximately equal teams can be engineered.

... and, whatever you do, don't forget the hats!
