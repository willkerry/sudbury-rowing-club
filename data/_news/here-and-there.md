**Sudbury Rowers represented the club at both the Cambridge Autumn Regatta and Chicago River Marathon this month.**

Sudbury Rowing Club attended the annual Cambridge Autumn Regatta on Sunday 8th September 2019. The Juniors once again put in a great performance, coming away with many wins and hard fought second places.

The B1 Women’s double of Amelia Moule and Martha Bullen won against Peterborough easily. Then, Sudbury’s Amelia Maskell and Sam McLoughlin won against club mates Helena Griffiths and Owen Moriarty by 2 lengths in the B1 Mixed doubles.

McLoughlin went on to win the Junior 18 single, beating Peterborough by half a length. In the Junior 15 single, Harry Moule also won against Peterborough, by 3 lengths.

The Mixed quad composite crew of Amelia Moule, Martha Bullen and Byron Bullen (of Sudbury RC) and Ben Mackenzie (of Peterborough RC), repeated their Sudbury Regatta success, and won the Mixed Quad Invitational Race.

Great racing was seen from all competitors.

**Sudbury goes to Chicago**.

Mark Tyrie of Sudbury Rowing Club joined the club’s group of rowers taking on international rowing challenges, when he competed in a composite eight crew at the recent Chicago River Marathon, also on the 8th September.

The Marathon starts early with crews gathering from 5am at Eleanor Boathouse in Bridgeport, which is another masterpiece of architectural design by Jeanne Gang.

It is a regatta that will challenge the toughest of rowers, who seek an adventurous row on its 26.2 mile course. The course covers the dynamic range of Chicago’s neighbourhoods and competitors row under or past every single one of the city’s historic movable bridges, of which Chicago has the most of any city in the world!

Rowing into Chicago’s city centre is limited to only a few occasions a year, as the waterways are very busy with traffic, water taxis, architectural tours, cruisers and party boats. So it is very much a privilege to row through the metropolis that is the birthplace of the Skyscraper.

As for the rowing conditions on the day, Mark Tyrie said ‘The morning of the event was lightly overcast with cool, perfect conditions, but I was wondering if ‘the windy city’ was going to live up to her name, fortunately for everyone taking part she didn’t blow’!
