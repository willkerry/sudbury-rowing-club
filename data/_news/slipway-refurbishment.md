Sudbury Rowing Club has recently undertaken the refurbishment of their boating slipway.

After more than 50 years, the old one had become cracked, dangerous and no longer fit for purpose. The repair has made the boating area safer for all members and also gave the club the opportunity to make access to the water for rowers with disabilities easier, particularly for athletes in wheelchairs.

Work was carried out by Gunite Solutions Ltd, who are concrete specialists, and Sudbury Rowing Club Facilities Manager, Hannah Lodge, oversaw the project.

The new slipway was used earlier this month by participants in the annual "Sudbury to the Sea" event who boated their canoes, kayaks and paddle boards.

A large amount of money came from club funds which had been saved over the past few years to help pay for the maintenance of club facilities. Angela Colclough, Fundraising Officer, has worked hard during this year to secure grants from various sources to assist the funding and which has subsequently allowed the club to carry out the repair work.

Special thanks goes to: Awards for All Big Lottery Fund, Babergh District Council, Ganzoni Charitable Fund and Geoffrey Burton Charitable Trust.

There was also funding from two Suffolk County Councillors, Richard Kemp and Colin Spence, who kindly donated money from their Locality Budget.

The club is very grateful to the above mentioned for all their support and without their generous funding the project could not have been completed.
