Sudbury Rowing Club’s newly formed Novice Coxed 4 successfully took to the water at Bedford Sprint Regatta, despite only having trained together for three weeks. Chris Page, Ben Toocaram, Louis Watson and Barney Walker, all university students returning home for the summer were fortunate to receive a row-over in their first race with their opposition failing to turn up. This saw the crew go straight through to the semi finals, racing against Broxbourne RC who the boys held off to win by 1 length, under the clever coxing taken by Kezia Tan.

The final saw Sudbury face a crew from Queen Mary University College London BC. As the race started, QMUL took the lead albeit by a canvass which they held onto until roughly the half way point of the race, with Sudbury maintaining a tight hold on their opponents. Sudbury managed to keep cool and make up the lost ground with both crews racing neck and neck towards the finish. With the finish line in sight the Sudbury Cox called for a last push as both crews battled it out. As the boats crossed the finish line it was hard to tell who had won. Then finally, the result was announced, with Sudbury winning by 1 length, an impressive win. The crew would like to thank their coach, Bob Howard for all of his time and effort and continued support.
