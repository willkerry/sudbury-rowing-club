Sunday the 4th of November saw Sudbury Rowing Club send two Men’s crews to compete in the Veteran Fours Head of the River Race.

This race is held over the Boat Race course on the Tideway stretch of the River Thames in London, although in reverse, from Mortlake to Putney, and attracts crews from all over the country.

Lee Adams, Tim Hysom, Stephen Nichols, Paul Adams and cox Helen Sharp raced in the Men’s Masters C coxed four. They competed against seven other crews in the 45 – 50 age category and finished a very creditable second place, achieving a time of 20:56.9. They overtook two crews on the water, but otherwise had a smooth row, making the most of the relatively mild weather.

The Men’s Masters G quad scull of Brendan Sullivan, Mike Arnott, Andrew Blit and Keith Paxman competed against ten other crews in their category, finishing in sixth place in a time of 22:11.1. The crew had a very good row for the first half of the race, dicing with a crew from Thames RC and overtaking one from Warwick. Unfortunately the race then took a more eventful turn with the quad coming into contact with two other crews in the middle of the race. This slowed them down a little but they still produced a good performance for such a recent crew combination.

Both crews will be looking to improve their performances for the next race, Wallingford Head, in two week's time.
