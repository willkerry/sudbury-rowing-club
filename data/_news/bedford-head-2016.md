Bedford Autumn Fours and Small Boats Head was well attended by Sudbury Rowing Club last weekend.

Crews raced over the 2000 metre course on a time trial basis with boats starting the racing at 15 second intervals.

There were two wins, the first one being the Mens Masters C coxed four of Lee Adams, Mark Tyrie, Stephen Nichols, Rob Frost and Helen Sharp (cox) in a time of 7 minutes 37 seconds. The second win was the new combination of Tracy Muir and Teresa Moriarty in the Women’s Masters D double sculls in a time of 9 minutes and 13 seconds.

There were some promising results for the juniors and a stand out performance from Sam McLoughlin in the Junior 15 Sculls where he finished in third place out of an entry of 46 scullers. A time of 8 minutes 50 seconds was recorded.

There were also some debut races for some scullers, Sean Moriarty competed in his first sculling race in the Mens Novice Sculls event and finished in a time of 9 minutes and 51 seconds. In the same event, Shyam Thobhani had his first sculling race and finished in a time of 8 minutes and 58 seconds. Jen Titterington raced in the Women’s IM3 Sculls event and finished in a time of 9 minutes and 48 seconds.

Some good performances throughout the day and with some benchmark scores now recorded, training will continue to improve the results at the next event.
