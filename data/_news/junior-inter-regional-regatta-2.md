Sudbury Rowing Club Junior 16 scullers Martha Bullen and Amelia Maskell competed for the East of England Team at the Junior Inter-Regional Regatta at the National Watersports Centre in Nottingham.

The six lane course covered a racing distance of 1500 metres.

In their heat, the Sudbury scullers struggled to find their normal race pace in the first half but with some competitive determination they managed to pull through the field to finish in third place, which secured a place in the A Final.

The final saw a tough line up with six very strong crews from all over England.

The Sudbury crew had a much better start and were very much in the race. They spent much of the race side by side with three other crews and at one point were in second place. In a very exciting race, positions changed every couple of strokes and eventually the Sudbury crew just missed out on a medal, finishing in fourth place, with only a few seconds separating 1st and 4th.

The next race will be The Ball Cup Junior Regatta at Dorney Lake.
