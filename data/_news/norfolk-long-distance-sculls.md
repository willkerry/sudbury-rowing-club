Sudbury took seven crews to Norwich for this 4200m event and came away with four victories.

The men’s senior 4, of David Bull, Sam Hogsjberg, Rob Frost and Trevor Chambers coxed by Kezia Tan put in a strong performance against some good competition but their strength prevailed to take them to a comfortable victory winning their event and the fastest time in the division.

The men’s four in the IM3 category of Lee Adams, Jeremy Milbank, Graham Morris and Keith Paxman were coxed to victory by Ellie Adams. Taking a good racing line throughout the race she eased the crew past the Norwich four and kept them ahead of the Lincoln crew to win the race.

Paul Hamblett took victory in the IM1 single scull race after another strong showing and was awarded the fastest time of the day, securing the Norwich Shield again.

Kezia Tan and Abi Malster in the women’s J18 pair rowed well together over a testing distance but continued to show their pairing work well together securing their third victory together.

Mike Arnott in Vet E single scull race, started well but after some miss-steering taking him into the bank, this cost him some valuable time and the chance for victory.

The Sudbury women’s quad of Rosemary Hogsjberg, Pippa Kerry, Katherine Cass and Emma Coone showed a strong performance, but with no competition this proved a valuable outing in preparation for the Head of the River race in London in November.

Finally, the men’s senior 4 entered the afternoon session, this time coxed by Ellie Adams, but with no competition it too provided a lesson in stamina ready for the forthcoming 4.25 mile Head of River race.

An excellent start to the year for Sudbury, with a target of 40 wins for the year they have already ticked off 7 so far, and with the availability of new crew options continuing, a healthy outlook for the club is assured.
