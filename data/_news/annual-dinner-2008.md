The annual dinner on Saturday 25 October was once again held at the Bull Hotel, Long Melford. Successfully organised by Rob Frost we enjoyed good food and company (some of us even spotted a 'bloke off the telly'!) and celebrated our rowing year.

After some speeches from Tricia (Chairman) and Mike (Captain 2007/08) looking back over our successes and memorable events (good and bad) the traditional SRC awards ceremony began.

And the winners were...

- **Stour Shield** - David Wasse
- **Senior Award** - jointly to the Ladies Quad (Rosemary, Sally, Katherine & Sarah) & Paul Hamblet
- **Junior Award** - Jocelyn Ralph

The rest of the evening was spent dancing the night away to the live band!
