The club had a successful weekend at St. Neots regatta over the weekend. The women's 8+ confirmed their competitive season by winning the S3 event, and providing a good race in their S2 heat, losing to a mean-looking AK crew. Four of the Sudbury crew won their novice pot in this event (Liz, Dawn, Mel and Julie), which had 4 entries, in a convincing 1Â¾ length win over the Lea. The men's senior 4 proved they can do it coxed as well as coxless by winning the S2 4+ event, also from the Lea, by 3ft in a close final in the 9 boat event, after winning their heats with some to spare. The other Sudbury entry was Robert Frost in a large Novice sculls field, who narrowly lost in a heat.

On the sunday the mixed four won the S2 4+ event, and Tony narrowly lost the final of Vet B 1x on very little sculling this season. Robert persevered through to the final of the Novice 1x event from a field of 12 but lost by half a length. A win musty be on the cards soon...
