Sunday the 14th April saw the club’s rowers competing in force with a total of 12 adult and 10 junior crews taking part over 6 divisions on the day.

With decent racing conditions on a very cold but sunny day, Sudbury achieved 7 wins!

The Open Double Scull of siblings Owen Moriarty and Morgan Moriarty won in a time of 7.59. The Mixed Double Scull of siblings Tom Bowles and Amy Bowles representing both SRC and Radley Mariners won with a time of 7.42.

The Women’s Junior 15 Coxed Quad of Amelia Moule (cox); Grace Power; Evie Prager; Emilie Larkin and Amy Wallace continued their fabulous winning form, taking a 3rd win in their 3rd ever competition race in a time of 8.31.

The Women’s Double Sculls of Amelia Moule and Martha Bullen won with a time of 8.09, and the Women’s Masters C Double Sculls of Sophie Lovegrove and Jen Ward won with a time of 9.09.

Finally SRC’s newly formed Women’s Masters D Coxed Quad of cox Pippa Kerry; Debbie Nott; Jackie Lloyd; Veronica Yates and Angela Sayer (pictured above), looking to compete after Storm Freya cancelled their first planned race at St Neots last month, finally took to the water for their first ever competitive race.

They won their first race of the day in a time of 9.32 with a 28 seconds lead over their nearest competition. Later that day they raced for a second time and won once more, this time in 9.14 with a lead of 44 seconds! A stunning performance!

One unfortunate incident beset the 2nd race of the day for the Masters D Coxed Four of Helen Sharp (cox), Lee Adams; Paul Adams; Stephen Nichols and John Bowles. They had achieved 2nd place earlier in the day with a good time of 7.46. They looked to be on track for an even better time when their bow rigger broke away from the boat, sadly putting them out of the race.

They took it in good spirits, only complaining that had they taken their wallets with them in the boat, they could have gone for a pint in the club house where their rigger had come off instead!

Congratulations not only to the winning crews but also all of the other crews who fought some hard races to achieve second and third places and some good times, making Sudbury Rowing Club very proud.

Elsewhere, the Women’s Double of Jen Titterington (SRC) and Bev Goodchild (Ipswich RC) were also racing all weekend at Ghent International Spring Regatta and continuing their success by winning both days!

All in all, a great racing weekend for Sudbury Rowing Club!
