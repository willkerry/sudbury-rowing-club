Sudbury Rowing Club recently received a grant from [The Rowing Foundation](http://www.therowingfoundation.org.uk/), enabling the purchase of six junior lifejackets.

The lifejackets will be used to support juniors on 'Start Rowing' courses, until they are able to demonstrate sufficient competence on the water, and have passed their Capsize Drill.
