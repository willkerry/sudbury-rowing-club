Three members from Sudbury Rowing Club took part in the Scullers Head of the River Race on the River Thames at the weekend.

It was the first time that any of them had competed in the event - which included over 500 scullers from all over the country as well as overseas.

Scullers have to be over 16 years old and have significant experience to compete, as the Thames can be gruelling on a bad day.

The four mile stretch of the Thames is a difficult course to navigate for scullers as the stream, tide and weather conditions are changing constantly.

Fastest out of the three Sudbury scullers was Byron Bullen, who had a very strong row, steering well and finishing in a time of 20 minutes 40 seconds, competing in the Men's Junior 17 category.

Jen Titterington finished in an excellent, category winning time of 21 minutes 11 seconds, beating 8 other scullers in the Senior Women's event.

Amelia Moule raced in the Women's Junior 17 category, again having a superb race and finishing in a time of 22 minutes 3 seconds.

All three scullers enjoyed the race experience and felt a sense of achievement in completing one of the country's biggest sculling events.

The next event will be the British Rowing Indoor Championships.
