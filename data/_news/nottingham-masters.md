Sudbury Rowing Club attended two separate events last weekend, The Ball Cup, for juniors, held at Dorney Lake, Bucks, and Nottingham Masters Regatta, held at the National Water Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont.

At the Masters Regatta, two crews competed, with each entering two events.

Despite their finals being only 40 minutes apart, the Masters D/E double scull of Teresa Moriarty and Tracy Muir (above) managed to win both of their events.

To win the first race was a great achievement, as they were competing against younger opposition, but to go straight back down the lake and race again, and win, was amazing! Both ladies were thrilled with the result, and wish to thank Terry Gostling for the time he has given to coaching them over the last year.

Their first winning time over the 1000m course was 4:24, and the second 4:26.

The Masters C/D coxed four of Helen Sharp (cox), Lee Adams, Tim Hysom, Stephen Nichols and Paul Adams also raced twice, with their finals only 28 minutes apart.

Despite also racing younger opposition in their first event, the Sudbury crew fought back from a poor start to finish just one second behind the winners, a composite crew from Bedford, in a time of 3:39.

In their second final, racing in their age group, the toll of the earlier race was apparent, and they were unable to maintain an early lead, eventually losing by one length to City of Bristol RC, recording a time of 3:48.

Cruelly, their earlier time would have easily seen them win the race !
