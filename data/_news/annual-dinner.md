It’s September already, that only means one thing - Annual Dinner time.

On Saturday 18th October it’s Sudbury Rowing Club’s Annual Dinner and Dance, a chance to get out of the lycra and dress up! This year it is taking place at Sudbury Rugby Club, with Stock and Bailey catering and Dreamwave Events as the evenings entertainment. The evening will begin with canapes and be followed by a 2 course meal, speeches, awards and a disco.

Lets celebrate all we have achieved this year! Contact Holly Adams for more information and to buy your tickets - [social@sudburyrowingclub.org.uk](mailto:social@sudburyrowingclub.org.uk).
