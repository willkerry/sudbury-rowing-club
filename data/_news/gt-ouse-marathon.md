Sunday 1st September saw Sudbury Rowing Club competing in force at the annual [Gt. Ouse Marathon](https://www.elyrowingclub.org.uk/index.php/clubevents/great-ouse-marathon).

The course starts from Denver Sluice, travelling along a lengthy route of 21.5km down to the finish line at Queen Adelaide Bridge, close to Ely. This is a long distance race testing rowers endurance.

This year 15 members from the club competed in decent sunny conditions with a light headwind. Good times were achieved by those racing, with some crews improving on previous race times, and some competing for the very first time.

Andrew Blit, competing in the Open Masters Singles achieved a time of 2:06:14. Sean Moriarty and Jeremy Milbank, in the Open Masters F/G/H Doubles achieved a time of 1:49:06. Morgan Moriarty, racing in a Single achieved a time of 1:48:52, and Stephen Nichols and Veronica Yates, racing in the Mixed Masters D/E Doubles, achieving a time of 1:47:02.

Sophie Lovegrove and Pete Donovan, racing in a Mixed Masters B Double achieved a time of 1:44:36, but were narrowly beaten by the Mixed Masters B Double of Tim Wallace and Poppy Grosch, who set a course record in a time of 1:44:25.

Mike Arnott and Pippa Kerry competed in the Mixed Masters F Double in a time of 1:44:15 and a composite crew from Deben and Sudbury, including the new Sudbury member Arsalan Zahid, competed in a Quad which achieved a time of 1:34:36, finishing in the second fastest time of all competing entries. Sophie Brown continued her success by setting a new category record for her PR2 Single in 2:52:17.

Finally, many congratulations go to the excellent performance of the Womenâ€™s Masters E Double of Teresa Moriarty and Tracy Muir, who won their race category in a time of 1:53:31, beating their opposition by 19 mins.

Well done to all competitors from Sudbury, who rowed hard and paced themselves well.
