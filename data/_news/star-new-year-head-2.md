Sudbury Rowing Club’s New Year got off to a tremendous start at Bedford Star’s Head of the River Race on Sunday 13th of January. It was a bright but cold and windy day and the course was slightly shortened due to a fallen tree near the race starting point.

A grand total of 8 wins were achieved with the Junior squad delivering a fantastic performance, winning 5 of the first places.

Starting with Harry Moule in the J14 1x with a time of 6:06; Fergus Grant in the J15 1x with a time of 7:53; and Amelia Moule, WJ18 1x with a time of 7:55.

Junior doubles, Amelia Moule and Martha Bullen competed in the WJ18 2x with a time of 7:02 and Sam McLoughlin and Byron Bullen in the J18 2x with a time of 6.44. The Women’s crews also put in a brilliant performance with the Master’s double of Sophie Lovegrove and Jen Ward winning both of their races with a best time of 07:44 and the Sudbury/Ipswich double of Bev Goodchild and Jen Titterington with a time of 06:55.

In addition to all of the club’s wins there was some very close and exciting racing seen for a number of second places in very windy and choppy rowing conditions. Promising new racing teams took their first competitive steps, notably the Junior Girls coxed quad of Grace Power; Emilie Larkin; Evie Prager; Amy Wallace and cox Amelia Moule, achieving a time of 7:53, racing for the very first time along with a mixed Masters Double of Tim Wallace and Poppy Grosch, who achieved a best time of 08:14.

The men’s teams also performed well, achieving some good times including the Men’s Masters coxed four of Lee Adams; Tim Hysom; Stephen Nichols; Paul Adams; Cox Helen Sharp, achieving a best time of 6:41 and the Men’s Master double of Simon White and Robin King with a time of 7:09.

A huge well done to all competitors and a great start to the year ahead.
