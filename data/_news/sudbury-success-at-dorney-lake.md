Sunday 28th April saw an accomplished group of Juniors from Sudbury Rowing Club travelling to compete at the Junior Sculling Regatta at the Olympic Rowing lake in Dorney, Windsor.

Competition at this event is of a very high level and attracts the top Junior rowers in Britain, including both the British Rowing World Class Start program as well as other future GB Internationals. Weather conditions made for challenging rowing conditions but despite this the juniors put on an excellent performance, representing their club well.

In the Women’s J18 singles, Amelia Moule won silver and in the Women’s J16 singles, Martha Bullen won bronze. In the Men’s J15 Singles, Harry Moule achieved an impressive fifth place, as he was racing against rowers one year older than him. In the J18 Men’s Singles Final, Byron Bullen claimed fourth place, missing out on the third place by less than half a second. Sam Mcloughlin also put in a very good performance, but was eliminated in the time trials racing against some tough competition.

Considering the size of SRC, competing against much bigger Schools and Clubs, this was a very accomplished performance by Sudbury’s Juniors.

A week later, on Sunday 5th May, Dorney Lake this time hosting Wallingford Regatta, saw another fantastic performance by Jen Titterington of Sudbury Rowing Club and Bev Goodchild of Ipswich Rowing club. They competed in The Women’s Challenge Double Sculls for the Wallingford Skiff Regatta Cup.

Continuing their exceptional winning record, they won their heat in a time of 7.35. Against strong competition they then went on to win their final with a time of 7.32.

Jen Titterington also claimed 4th place in the Women’s single sculls with a heat time of 8.06 and a final time of 8.27.

**Congratulations to all of our fabulous rowers!**
