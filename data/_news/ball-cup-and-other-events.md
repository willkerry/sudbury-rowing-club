Sudbury Rowing Club have had a busy few weeks, racing at various events.

Adaptive rowers Luke Payne And Sophie Brown competed at Henley-on-Thames and represented Sudbury Rowing Club in the Phyllis Court Regatta. Luke Payne took part in the Arms Only category and Sophie Brown in the Arms and Trunk category.

Jen Titterington has also been in action, competing at Wallingford Regatta, held at Eton Dorney. Weather conditions were particularly breezy and the 2000m six lane course was deemed too rough and dangerous which meant competitors had to race over a shorter distance of 1500m in a processional time trial style of racing. Titterington gained some valuable race experience in challenging conditions.

Sudbury Juniors were out in force at the Ball Cup Junior Regatta South at Eton Dorney, Olympic Venue. The course was raced over 750 metres and was over six lanes.
