Sudbury Rowing Club recently participated in the National Masters Rowing Championships at Holme Pierrepont, Nottingham.

The 2-day event, over a 1000m course, saw the Men’s Masters C crew of Lee Adams, Tim Hysom, Stephen Nichols, Paul Adams and cox Helen Sharp race firstly on the Saturday in the Non-Championship final, an event for anyone who hasn’t ever won at the regatta previously.

The Sudbury crew raced against York, Avon, Milton Keynes, Cantabrigian and Curlew rowing clubs. From the start it quickly turned into a 2 boat race as Sudbury and Curlew pulled away from the others into a strong head wind. At the 500m mark, Sudbury were ahead and Curlew tried a push but were held off by the Sudbury crew who took the win.

Sunday, the men raced again, this time in the Championship race, against Newark and Minerva Bath. Again, there was a strong head wind, but Sudbury pushed hard and pulled away from the Newark crew, chasing Minerva. At the half way mark Sudbury put in a big push and started to put Minerva under pressure, however they stayed strong and pushed away for the line. A good second place for Sudbury.

The Ladies’ Quad of Rosemary Hogsbjerg, Teresa Moriarty, Sarah Watts and Tracy Muir had a good race, coming home in 3rd place. The ladies then split into two doubles, Hogsbjerg and Watts racing first, in tough conditions coming home in a disappointing 5th place. Moriarty and Muir then raced and came from behind to finish 5th in their race too.

All crews are keen to thank the club coaches who have helped them: Terry Gostling, Bob Howard, Chris Jillings and Tony Hogsbjerg.
