Bedford Small Boats Head was another successful day out for members of Sudbury Rowing Club when they competed in the 2000 metre timed race.

Several crews won in various categories including Amelia Maskell and Martha Bullen who raced in, and won, the Girls Junior 16 Double Sculls event, closely followed by Amelia Moule and Nell Belcher in second place.

Another success came from the Ladies Junior 18 Quad Scull of Amelia Moule (stroke), Lucy Edwards, Julia van Zyl and Lucy Keedy-Davies (bow), who proved a strong combination and went on to win the Ladies Intermediate event (pictured).

The Men's Masters Quad Scull of Mike Arnott, Chris Jillings, Keith Paxman and Robin King also went on to win, in the Masters F event.

Jen Titterington won the Women's Intermediate Single Sculls event and is showing some very good form.

Crews are producing some excellent results and the Winter training is really paying off. As the crews now adapt their race pace in preparation for the regatta racing season, focus is on side by side racing, shorter distances at higher stroke rate, and stamina and fitness are as important as ever.

Good Friday was the traditional Easter Opening at Sudbury Rowing Club - a tradition of over 70 years! Members young and old got together, forming crews for sprint races, cheered on by family and friends on Friars Meadow. After the racing, everybody gathered at the clubhouse where tradition continued with beer and hot cross buns and the Mayor of Sudbury raised the flag and officially opened the regatta season.
