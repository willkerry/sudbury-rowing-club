Hi everyone and (probably unnecessary!) apologies for the lack of Captains information or update since I started.

So here’s a few things:

# **Men’s Vice Captain**

We are still in need of a Men’s Vice Captain to lead and motivate the Men’s Crew….if you are interested and want to talk to me please let me know asap!

# Recent Events

## Alton Water Head

It was great to see SRC supporting the inaugural Alton Water Head and we had some Wins/Pennants

- Women’s Quad
- Women’s Pairs
- Men’s Mas Double

## Scullers Head

- Tom Bowles _102 overall and 17th in category_
- Mike Arnott _281 overall and 7th in category_
- Molly Shaw _320 overall and 7th in category_

Well done all three of you

## 4’s Head and Vet’s 4’s Head

Some good results at this event over these 2 days. The boys 4x- were unhappy with their row on Sat but went on to improve dramatically on the second day to finish 66th and 6th out of 12 in their category.

The Men’s IM1 crew on Saturday had a great result finishing 14th out of 22 and 211th overall. On the Sunday the Men’s IM3 crew had a good row in their first event on the Tideway and the Men’s MasC crew had an excellent result finishing 49th overall and 4th of 7 in their category

Finally the Mixed Mas 4x came an excellent 2nd of 4 in their category and 119th overall

There were 450 competing crews on Saturday and 200 competing crews on the Sunday

Apologies if I missed any events anyone went to.

# Pudding Races

Just a reminder that the Puddings Races are arranged for Saturday 21st December. This is a great event for everyone to attend and have some fun and to share with family if you want to bring them along.

# Christmas and New Year

I would like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and New Year (just in case I don’t get the chance again)!

Thanks

SRC Captain
