Peterborough’s summer event is traditionally both hard to win and to enter. This year they managed to squeeze in about 380 competing crews each day but had still had to turn back more than 200 entries of which a proportion were ours. Again I am grateful to David for putting together as much as he could.

Our sweep-oared crews did not fare that well with Senior 3 8s on both days reaching repechages but no more. The S3 4 of Sant, Paxman, Wijnberg and Bull fared a lot better on the Sunday than the Saturday at least being ‘in the mix’ up to the Semi. Our WS 4 4+ was unfortunately disqualified owing to events outside their control and I am in correspondence with the regatta over this. We are all grateful to Sue for doing so much coxing in miserable conditions.

Our scullers were somewhat stronger. Paul Hamblett raced well to reach the final of S3 on the Saturday though the distance proved just too short for him in the end, the winner being someone he had beaten over 2,000m earlier in the year. Sue Tickner raced at WJ16 and was unfortunate enough to come up against Bream of Peterborough but she did beat at least one girl who had been faster than her earlier in the year.

The S3 2x of Paul and Sam came together really well on Sunday. Having survived the battle of the hangovers early in the morning they progressed with greater and greater strength to win the final and lose their Novice status. Congratulations go to the boys.
