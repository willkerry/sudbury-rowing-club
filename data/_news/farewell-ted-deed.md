It is with great regret that we report the passing of Ted Deed on 31 January, 2012. Ted was a Vice President of Sudbury Rowing Club for many years and rowed at the club during the nineties. He rowed in many other countries, especially in The Philippines where he was a long time member of Manila Boat Club and their Captain 1977/78. The Manila Boat Club has organised a wreath laying ceremony for Wednesday 8 September 2012 and says:

> 'The MBC colours will be flown at half-mast until 8pm on February 8th when they will be lowered, together with the Philippine Flag to the playing of the Last Post. A commemorative wreath will then be cast into the Ilog Pasig in memory of SVO Ted's last trip downstream. It is compulsory that all attendees have their tankards and glasses charged and drink heartily to the memory of our lost Captain.'

(The title SVO stands for 'Senior Veteran Oarsman'). There are more details and pictures of Ted on the [MBC website](http://www.manilaboatclub.com/news/farewell-ted-deed-boat-captain-197778).

Ted's most memorable appearance at Sudbury was in a Sudbury/Manila composite 4+ with his son Mike at the 1991 Sudbury International Regatta. The picture below shows him with his family at that regatta wearing the MBC/SRC shirts he had made especially for the event.

Ted's cremation will take place at Colchester Crematorium on Monday 13 February at 11:45am.
