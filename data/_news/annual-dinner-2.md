On Saturday 17th October it’s Sudbury Rowing Club’s Annual Dinner and Dance, a chance to get out of the lycra and dress up!

This year it is taking place at AFC Sudbury. The evening will begin with a welcome drink and canapes, to be followed by a 2 course meal, speeches, awards and dancing.

Lets celebrate all we have achieved this year!
