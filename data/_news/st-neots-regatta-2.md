Sudbury Rowing Club competed at the St. Neots two day regatta in very changeable weather over the weekend.

Saturday's racing was over a distance of 1000 metres, which included a challenging bend. Seventeen crews raced on Saturday including two men's eights, a mixed eight, three coxed fours, three women's quads, a coxless pair, four double sculls and three single sculls.

There were some excellent races - some in very heavy rain. Winning crews were Amelia Maskell and Amelia Moule in the Women's Junior 16 double sculls event. Winners of Women's Double Sculls event was a composite crew of Jen Titterington (Sudbury) and Bev Goodchild (Ipswich).

Racing started early on Sunday, some of the Sudbury crews took to the water before 9.00. The course was more of a sprint event with the distance being 500 metres. There were fifteen Sudbury crews competing - a women's coxed four, a women's quad, six double sculls, and seven single sculls.

The most exciting race of the day came from Junior 16 Double scull of Byron Bullen and Sam McLoughlin who had such a close race in the semi final against Peterborough, it was declared as a dead heat. The crews returned to the start for an immediate re-race. The Sudbury crew were triumphant the second time round and earned a place in the final.

Winning crews were Women's Masters C double scull of Susie Moule and Sophie Lovegrove in their debut race together, Amelia Maskell and Martha Bullen in the Women's Junior 15 double sculls event, Martha Bullen also won the Women’s Junior 14 single sculls event. Amelia Moule continued her winning streak, taking her second win of the weekend in the Women's Junior 16 Single sculls event.
