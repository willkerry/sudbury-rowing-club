Sudbury Rowing Club's Junior 15 sculler Amelia Moule competed in the Junior National Championships at the National Watersports Centre in Nottingham, where the course is notoriously choppy.

There were 31 Women's Junior 15 single scullers, of which only 12 could progress through to the semi finals on Sunday. The 31 scullers had to complete a 1500 metre time trial and hope that they had done enough to make the top 12 places.

Amelia had a good race and handled the conditions well, maintaining her strength, pace and rhythm, finishing in 18th position, in a time of 7 minutes 46 seconds, beating 13 other scullers. This result took Amelia into the C Final which would be a six lane 2000 metre race later in the day. Unfortunately, conditions worsened during the afternoon and the course was deemed unrowable before the C, D and E finals could be raced.

So with racing cancelled, Amelia was left wondering whether she could have improved her ranking from 18th position, but thoughts are now focused on next weekends racing which takes place at the St. Neots two day regatta.
