Sudbury Rowing Club held a boat naming ceremony on Saturday the 20th July in honour of Richard Kemp, the local councillor for Long Melford. Richard is a local businessman who has been involved in local politics for 45 years, as a Babergh District Councillor, Magistrate & recently retired as a local Parish Councillor.

As a thank you for his continued support of Sudbury Rowing club over many years, the club wanted to name a boat in his honour. He has supported grass roots sports in the area, and in particular Sudbury Rowing Club for many years, even as budgets have diminished he has tried to give something each year from his locality budget to support local sport and in particular youth sport.

Mr Kemp chose for the boat to be named “Richard Luff-Kemp” in honour of his family’s history. Mr Kemp & his wife joined the Rowing Club for the traditional naming ceremony on Saturday morning.

The club also named a coxed four in recognition of a recent bequest from another local benefactor. Mr Brian Weedon made a significant donation to the club in his will last year and in honour of this gift, and with a distinct nod to his sense of humour, the boat was named “Life of Brian”.

You will be able to see both the “Richard Luff-Kemp” and “Life of Brian” in action on the water, competing at Sudbury Regatta on Saturday 3rd August.
