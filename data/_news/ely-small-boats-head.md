Two Sudbury Rowing Club Juniors represented the club at last weekends Ely Head Race held at the Isle of Ely rowing club.

Rowing over a 3km distance against a number of other clubs Byron Bullen won in the Junior 18 category and Martha Bullen won in the Womens Junior 16 category. Competing against some very high level Junior competition both juniors did exceptionally well in some tough conditions where the strong wind caused issues for everyone competing due to the head wind and very choppy conditions.

Following the first division being completed all competitors observed a two minute silence to mark the 100th Armistice anniversary before Martha Bullen also competed in the Womens Junior 16 quad. Unfortunately the girls didnâ€™t have any competition so were only racing for time and posted a great time finishing 6th fastest from all crews and the fastest female crew in the second division.
