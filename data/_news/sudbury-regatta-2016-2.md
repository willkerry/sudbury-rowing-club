**Entries to Sudbury Regatta are filling up and we presently anticipate a very full day !**

We will do our best to squeeze as much racing in as we can and to accommodate all requests. However, it may be that we will be unable to match everyone or that some events are not viable. Please let us know if you have an entry you would like us to give especial priority to, or an individual who must race if at all possible (for example, the trailer driver, deserving club administrator, returning from holiday especially for this event). We cannot promise to honour every request but will do our best with the information we have.
