There was some close racing today at the traditional Good Friday Opening.

The Club President, Town Mayor Sue Ayres, opened the season by raising the flag, and handing out prizes of Easter Eggs to the winning team of the day, the 'Cross Bunnies'!

It was also an opportunity for some of the 'Old Boys' to test out the new equipment...
