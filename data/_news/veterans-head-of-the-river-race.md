Sudbury Rowing Club competed in the Masters Head of the River Race on the Thames, racing from Mortlake to Putney, just over four miles.

There were 211 crews overall, competing in various age categories.

The Sudbury crew of Keith Paxman, Mike Arnott, Mark Tyrie, Sean Moriarty, Robin King, Stephen Nichols, Paul Adams, Lee Adams (stroke) and Amelia Moule (cox) were entered in the Masters E category - average age above 55.

The cloudy but dry conditions were good, with very little wind.

The crew had a really good row over the course and with some dominant coxing from Amelia they took full advantage of the stream and held the favourable course.

They overtook six crews and finished in 51st place overall, in a time of 20 minutes 21 seconds.

In the Masters E category they finished in 10th place out of 28 crews.
