Sudbury Rowing Club hosted their 136th annual regatta on Saturday with their largest and busiest event yet. Over 200 races took place in glorious conditions on the River Stour and spectators lined the riverbank enjoying the racing, picnicking and listening to the band playing.

The full course is 650 metres long with crews racing side by side and they have the added challenge of steering around the bend at speed! The Sprint Eights event is 350 metres along Friars Meadow and proved to be fast and exciting with some very close finishes!

Although the Sudbury crew of George Jackson, George Cook, Tom Horton, Jack McLoughlin, Alex Blackman, Keiron Dibley, Tom Bowles, Mark Hughes, Holly Adams (cox) won their heat, they were beaten in the semi final by the eventual winners - a Broxbourne/Tideway Scullers/Molesey BC composite crew.

This year the youngest competitors were the Junior 11 single scullers from Maidstone, Rob Roy in Cambridge and Sudbury. The Sudbury sculler Harry Moule had his very first regatta race against the sculler from Maidstone, crossing the line first and showing some real potential. The eventual winner was Rob Roy.

Lots of racing for the Sudbury crews including Men's novice coxed four of Sean Moriarty, Alan Muir, Shyam Thobhani, Charlie Downie, Michelle Risby (cox), Womens novice coxed four of Sophie Lovegrove, Angela Colclough, Sharon Wright, Maria Vigneau and Helen Sharp (cox). Both crews racing well to win their heats and gaining places in the finals where unfortunately their opposition was too strong.

The Parent and Child races proved popular this year with ten crews in the category. The three Sudbury crews of Antony and Amelia Moule, Austin and Molly Shaw, and Victoria and Alistair Burgess, all with various levels of experience, raced well but unfortunately didn't gain places in the finals.

Lots of juniors competed in various crews, showing competitive spirit and some true potential. There were wins from Callum Power in the Junior 18 single scullers event, who also teamed up with Morgan Moriarty in the Junior 18 double sculls, also taking the win in this event. The Junior 16 double sculls event was won by Natasha Treagust and Emma Rogers. The Junior 15 double sculls event was also won by a Sudbury crew of Nell Belcher and Amelia Moule.

Another win for Sudbury came from the Women's novice coxed quad of Jen Titterington, Asha Thobhani, Catherine Smith, Vickie Hayton and Amelia Moule (cox), who have had various races over the summer, gaining experience and confidence, and thoroughly enjoyed their win!

The next race will be at the Peterborough Summer two day regatta.
