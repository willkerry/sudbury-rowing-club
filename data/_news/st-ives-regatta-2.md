Sudbury Rowing Club had more success at the St. Ives regatta last week, with a win from Jeremy Milbank in his debut in a single scull, winning the Masters F single sculls event.

Also triumphant were Martha Bullen in the Junior 14 single sculls event, Amelia Moule and Nell Belcher in the Junior 16 double sculls event and the youngest member of Sudbury Rowing Club, Harry Moule, won the Junior 12 single sculls category.

The club had representatives in many other events, with some excellent racing during the day and some very close finishes.

Tracy Muir had a busy day, racing in the Women's Masters D double sculls with Teresa Moriarty, then with Jeremy Milbank in the Mixed Masters D double scull, and finally taking to the water in the Women's Masters D single category.

Also racing were Sam McLoughlin and Byron Bullen, competing in a Junior 16 double scull and also in single sculls.

Helena Griffiths and Jemima Savage raced in the Junior 15 double scull event, Morgan Moriarty competed in the Junior 18 single scull, Amelia Moule raced in Junior 16 single sculls and Nell Belcher made her debut in the Women's IM3 single sculls event.

Amelia Moule and Amelia Maskell also competed in the GB Junior 16 trials in Nottingham. The 1500 metre course was hindered by a headwind which was unfavourable for some crews. The relatively newly formed Sudbury crew rowed well together against some very strong opposition from all over the country. They gained valuable experience, finishing in a time of 6 minutes 39 seconds. The winning crew was from Northwich Rowing Club.

The next event will be the St. Neots two day regatta and the Sudbury Regatta will be held on Saturday 5th August.
