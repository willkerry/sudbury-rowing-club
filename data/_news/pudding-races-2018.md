Sudbury Rowing club held its annual Pudding Races on the 22nd December.

The event, which saw the rowers compete against each other in a bid to win the grand prize of Christmas Puddings (and the honour of best fancy dress) was again well attended.

Many friends, family and past members came along to cheer on the 40 rowing competitors who were split into two teams of 20, namely Team Chestnut and Team Sprout.  

The teams were split into different boats, eights; quads; double sculls and an adaptive single, and each pair of competing crews raced along Friars Meadow three times, with the start adjusted each time to accommodate the winning margin from the previous race. The winning team was decided by the number of crews on each that won their ‘best of 3’ races.

The winning rowing team of SRC’s 2018 Pudding Races were ‘The Sprouts’!

The best fancy dress prize in the Junior squad was awarded to Amelia Moule and Pete Donovan won the title in the adult squad.

Great fun was had by everyone and the Sprouts all took home their puddings!
