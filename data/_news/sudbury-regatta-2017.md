Owing to the popularity of the Regatta we have now closed entries to any further crews. The Draw will take place, as advertised, on Monday and we will be trying to arrange as much entertaining and competitive racing as we can.

We will be writing to clubs where we have problems accommodating your crews and please do not hesitate to get in touch with us with any queries or information you have - the best email address is on the poster.
