Sudbury Rowing Club attended the Ball Cup Junior Regatta, Eton Dorney and competed on the 2012 Olympic Rowing course. The 750 metre course was six lanes wide and conditions were near perfect.

Harry Moule and Fergus Grant had their debut race in the Junior 14 double sculls category. They rowed very well to win their heat, taking them into the final where they found themselves against some very strong crews. They rowed well together, finishing in fourth place.

Fergus also paired up with Owen Moriarty to race in the Junior 15 double sculls event where they finished fifth in their heat.

Harry Moule also competed in the Junior 13 single sculls event where he had a very strong heat, finishing in second place. His time was quick enough to take him into the final where, again, he had some strong competition. The first four crews were battling it out for the medal positions but Harry came a very close fourth, just missing out on a bronze medal.

Owen Moriarty competed in the Junior 15 single sculls event. Although he finished fourth in his heat, he achieved an admirable time which took him into the final. He raced well to finish in fifth position.

The first medal of the day came from Gareth Moriarty and Henry Tullin in the Junior 18 double sculls event. There were three crews in the straight final and the Sudbury crew battled it out for gold medal position but just missed out on gold, taking a silver medal for their efforts.

Amelia Moule raced in the Girls Junior 17 single sculls event where she won her heat convincingly. In the final, she was in second place for most of the race but her strength really showed when she managed to row past her opposition in the closing stages, securing a win and earning a gold medal.

Amelia Maskell competed in the Girls Junior 16 single sculls event which was a straight final with four crews racing. The Sudbury sculler overcame her nerves to take the gold medal.

Martha Bullen and Helena Griffiths both competed in the Girls Junior 15 single sculls event. Martha Bullen was the winner of heat 1. Helena Griffiths came second in heat 3. Both girls achieved good times which secured them places in the final. Another exciting race, which saw Martha finish strongly to take the gold medal. Helena also raced well to finish in fifth position.

Byron Bullen had to wait all day for his race - a straight final in the Junior 17 single sculls event. Byron took a while to get into his race and was sitting in third place for the first half. With his supporters urging him on, he started to gain on his opposition, and rowed into second place, taking the silver medal.

The Girls quad of Freya Evans, Martha Bullen, Amelia Maskell and Amelia Moule raced in the Junior 18 category and had a straight final with six crews. The Sudbury crew didn't have the best start but settled into their rhythm and used their power to propel them past their opposition. They couldn't quite reach the finish line first but managed silver medal position.

Coach Antony Moule was extremely pleased with the results - 3 gold medals, 3 silver medals with everyone, even the younger, less experienced, reaching the finals. Every Crew showed commitment and determination and should be very proud of their results.

The next event will be National Schools Regatta held at the same venue.
