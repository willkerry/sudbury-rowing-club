_Good Friday, 18 April 2014_

You are all most welcome to attend and to bring along family and friends to celebrate the official club opening and as part of this we will be unveiling the new land purchased this year.

For those of you that wish to take part there will also be an Easter Egg race between 2 “teams” in the morning for a bit of fun. There will be a race fee of £1 per seat collected on the day.

We will be offering Hot Cross Buns, Bacon Rolls (cooked on the BBQ), drinks and cakes throughout the morning. If you would like to make and donate some cakes please bring them along on the day.

The timetable for the day is:

**08:30** Rowers arrive at the club for sorting into teams **09:00** Teams/Boats are sorted and crews take to the water **09:30 (ish)** Races start, a single division rowing up the meadow **11:30** Mayor of Sudbury arrives at the club **12:00** Official opening of the club by the Mayor, raising of the flag and unveiling of the new land.

As a reminder, please dress smartly for the opening of the club, in club blazers if possible.

There is a Fun Run taking part in Sudbury on the day so roads will be closed and traffic slow. The race takes place between 09:15 and 11:00.

I look forward to seeing you all there.

Many thanks,

Tim
