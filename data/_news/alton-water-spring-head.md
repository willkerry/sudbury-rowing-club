Sudbury Rowing Club entered some veteran (or "Masters" as they are now known) crews for this event, which was organised by the recently formed Alton Rowing Club.  Most of the opposition was from local rowing clubs, including Beccles Rowing Club, Deben Rowing Club from Woodbridge, Essex University Rowing Club and Alton Rowing Club.

Racing on a lake is very different from racing on the Stour and many crews found conditions difficult.  There was a strong crosswind which created some rough water in parts of the course and made steering quite difficult.

Successful Sudbury Crews were Pippa Kerry and Bryony Dixon in Women's Masters double sculls, Keith Paxman and Mike Arnott in Men's Masters double sculls, Pippa Kerry and Jeremy Milbank in Mixed Masters double sculls and Mike Arnott in Masters single sculls.
