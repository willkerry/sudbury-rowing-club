Four members of the junior squad competed at the British Rowing Junior Championships held at the National Watersports Centre in Nottingham.

Amelia Moule raced up a year in the Girls Junior 18 single sculls event, finishing the 1500 metre time trial in 19th position out of a field of 37 scullers. Her time of 6.46 secured her a place in the D final. All finals are raced over the full 6 lane, 2000 metre course and Amelia raced well and led for most of the race but couldnâ€™t manage to hold on to the lead but finished in second place in a very good time time of 9.26 - an overall finishing position of 20th in the country.

Byron Bullen also raced up a year in the Junior 18 single sculls event finishing the time trial in a time of 5.52 out of a field of 36, securing a place in the C final. He raced well to finish in fifth place in a time of 8.50 - 17th in the country.

Byron Bullen also doubled up with Sam McLoughlin to race in the Junior 18 double sculls event. They finished their time trial in a time of 5.37 in 12th place out of 18 in the category. This gained them a place in the semi final where they finished in 6th place in a time of 7.51. They then went on to complete the B final in a time of 7.55 having a very fast last 500 meters coming through the field to take third position, 9th in the country.

Martha Bullen competed in the Girls Junior 15 single sculls event where she had a very good time trial finishing in 2nd place out of 29, in a time of 6.31. In the semi final Martha finished in second place in a time of 9.07 which was enough to make the A final later in the day, where she finished in 4th position achieving a very good time of 9.18.

The junior squad competed extremely well at this high profile event in very hot conditions, and alongside the best juniors from all over the country.

The next event for Sudbury will be St Neots two day Regatta this week before the Sudbury Regatta on the 4th August.
