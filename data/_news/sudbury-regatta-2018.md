Sudbury Rowing Club held their annual regatta on Saturday with crews travelling from far and wide to compete.

Although entries were slightly down on previous years, the day was packed with exciting races in all categories from Juniors to Masters, single sculls to sprint eights. There were also four adaptive rowers, including Sudbury members Luke Payne and Sophie Brown, who competed against adaptive scullers from Marlow and Twickenham, who are trialling for the GB para-Olympic team.

The 650 metre course always proves a challenge to visiting crews and sometimes even the most accomplished crews get caught out by the bend.

Sudbury crews included a Mixed Junior eight, Men’s Masters eight, Men’s four, Ladies Masters four, Men’s double, Junior doubles, and various single sculls.

Winning crews were Martha Bullen (Women’s Junior 15 single), Byron Bullen (Men’s Junior 17 single), Amelia Maskell and Amelia Moule (Women’s Junior 17 double), Gareth Moriarty and Amelia Maskell (Mixed double), Harry Moule and Antony Moule (Parent and Child double), Amelia Moule, Amelia Maskell, Freya Evans, Helena Griffiths and Harry Moule (cox) (Women’s Junior 17 coxed quad), Jen Ward and Sophie Lovegrove (Women’s Masters double), Jen Titterington and Martha Bullen (Women’s double), Byron Bullen and Ben MacKenzie (Peterborough) (Men’s Junior 18 double).

Regatta secretary Nicola Swift organised another very successful regatta, which was thoroughly enjoyed by spectators and participants alike.

The regatta was also praised for it's inclusion of an adaptive event, as reported by Adaptive Rowing UK, [here](http://adaptiverowinguk.com/index.php/2018/08/08/sudbury-regatta-2018/).
