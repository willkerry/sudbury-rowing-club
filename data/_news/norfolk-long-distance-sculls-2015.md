A number of Sudbury Rowing Club members travelled to Norwich to take part in the Norfolk Long Distance Sculls.

On a very balmy Autumn day, in almost perfect rowing conditions, two crews rowed the short distance course covering 2100m. Crews of Maria Vigneau and Claire Wells competed in the Women’s Novice Double Sculls category against Sudbury team mates Tricia McGrillen and Tracy Muir. After a strong race, McGrillen and Muir won their event in a time of 9 mins 44 secs.

In the long division, a distance of 4200m was completed by a number of Sudbury crews. The first to finish was the Mens Masters E Quad of Mike Arnott, Simon White, Keith Paxman and Stephen Nichols finishing in a time of 15.42. Next home was IM1 single sculler Tom Bowles in a time of 16.04.

Nick Scott raced in the Junior 17 Single Sculls event finishing in a time of 16.34, followed by Callum Power in the same event in 17.32. Women’s Junior 18 Single Sculler Victoria Burgess finished in 18.39. Natasha Treagust finished in a time of 19.55 and Amelia Moule in 19.59, both in their debut Head race in single sculls and racing in the Women’s Novice Category.

Rowing in the second division, again completing the long course, were Mixed Masters C Double Scull of Tim Hysom and Sophie Savage who finished in a time of 17.56, followed by Masters D Novice Double Scull of Sean Moriarty and Alan Muir in 18.27. Next to finish was the Mixed Masters D Double Scull of Keith Paxman and Jenny Ward in a time of 18.46. The Women’s Masters C Double of Maria Vigneau and Claire Wells finished in a time of 21.08.

Some solid results and good experience gained by all, as well as one win on the day.

Racing will continue through November with the crews attending the Cambridge Winter Head, Alton Autumn Head and Bedford Star Head.
