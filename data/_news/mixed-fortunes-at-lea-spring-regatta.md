An extensive range of Sudbury rowers went to compete, from those attending their first regatta to seasoned veterans of many a campaign. First up were Sue Tickner and Paul Hamblett, racing above their class in Mixed Senior 3 doubles. In a fine, classy scull they dominated their opponents from Lea and won by 2 lengths. At the other end of the age spectrum were Andrew Blit and Mike Arnott in their first competitive outing for 11 months at Veteran D, average age 50-55. Having been given a 4 seconds start against their younger opponents they did well for the first half of the race, before lack of basic fitness caught up, nothing that a little training would not cure however.

Then Louisa Hayes and Joscelyn Ralph competed in their first race as a Mixed Novice Double and they turned in a competitive and racey performance albeit losing to a crew of Juniors from the home club. Lots to build on there. This race was closely followed by a match up between the gnarled and serious vetereans of Lea against the relative tyros of Sudbry in Veteran C fours. Against the odds the Sudbury crew of Blit, Keith Paxman, Rob Snelling and David Bull coxed by Michelle Cole held the local heros for 2/3s of the course before succumbing by half a length on the line.

Then Hamblett, last seen sculling with Tickner raced at Senior 2 (well above his 'status') against a local sculler. He was unfortunate enough to find an opponent who had been invited to attend national trials and after being competitive to half way had to concede 2nd best.

Now another Sudbury win - the Senior 4 coxed 4 of Johny Myers, John Brooks, Snelling and Dan Worricker again coxed by Cole were strong and powerful enough to win their event against local opposition. This was followed by a narrow Sudbury loss at Senior 3 fours, with Myers, Paxman, Snelling, Bull and Cole being rowed through by an experienced University of Kent crew who were one of the clas crews of the entire regatta.

Oli Mitchell and Sue Tickner were unlucky enough to face up to Lea opposition marginally too strong at Mixed Junior double scull but Mitchell with Woricker were comfortably triumphant in their Novice double scull event against opponents from Maidstone.
