Sudbury Rowing Club had a number of crews entered and seven wins throughout the day in the Norfolk Sculls event where weather conditions were perfect.

The short course was 2100 metres and is predominantly for juniors and novice crews. Sudbury had two winning crews over this distance, the first being the women's junior 17 double scull of Natasha Treagust and Amelia Moule who were the fastest double in a time of 9 minutes 10 seconds. Martha Bullen also won her event, women's junior 15 single scull where she raced up an age group. She finished in a time of 10 minutes 52 seconds.

There were five more wins in the long distance event covering 4200 metres. In a time of 17 minutes 7 seconds, Steve Zimmerman was the fastest single sculler, also winning his event - masters B single sculls. Callum Power was next to finish, winning the Junior 18 single sculls event in 17 minutes 25 seconds. The Masters G single event was won by Brendan Sullivan in a time of 19 minutes 6 seconds.

Later in the day conditions deteriorated slightly and slower times were recorded. Callum Power and Steve Zimmerman teamed up to race in the IM3 double sculls, adding to their success and finishing in a time of 16 minutes 30 seconds. The last win of the day was Amelia Moule in the women's Junior 16 single sculls in a time of 21 minutes 12 seconds, claiming her second win of the day.

The next event for Sudbury Rowing Club will be at the Cambridge Winter Head in a couple of weeks where some new crew combinations will be competing.
