The girls Junior quad of Amelia Maskell, Helena Griffiths, Martha Bullen and Amelia Moule raced at Peterborough Spring Regatta on Saturday, racing over 1000 metres on the four lane course.

They competed in the Women's Open Coxless quad event where they won their heat in a time of 3.36. In the final, against Peterborough RC, Leeds RC and Leicester RC, the Sudbury crew had a very strong race to finish in first place in a speedy time of 3.27.

The second win of the day was Byron Bullen in the Junior 18 single sculling event. He won his heat in a time of 3.43 which secured him a place in the final. His opposition crews from Cambridge 99, Notts CRA and Nottingham RC were out sculled by the Sudbury sculler who won in a time of 3.47.

Other crews to race were Helena Griffiths in the Women's Junior 15 single sculls event, where she finished third in her heat in a time of 4.37, unfortunately missing out on a place in the final.

Sam McLoughlin raced in the Junior 16 single sculls event finishing his heat in a time of 4.01 just missing out on the final.

He also doubled up with Byron Bullen to compete in the Junior 18 double sculls event where they rowed well in the final, rowing past Rob Roy RC to take second place in a time of 3.36.

The girls Junior 16 double scull of Martha Bullen and Amelia Maskell finished second in their final in a time of 3.57 behind a very strong Leicester crew.

The Junior 14 double scull of Fergus Grant and Harry Moule finished third in their final in a time of 3.59.

Jen Titterington raced in a composite crew with Bev Goodchild from Ipswich RC in the Women's Double sculls event. They won their heat in 3.56 to secure a place in the final, where they came a very close second, 0.9 of a second behind a crew from Bath.

The two scullers also competed against each other in the Women's single sculls event. Goodchild won her heat in a time of 4.00 and Titterington came second in her heat, also in a time of 4.00 both meeting in the final together with scullers from Bath University. The Ipswich sculler finished in fourth place in 4.12, Sudbury finished in third place in 4.06.

In the Women's Junior 18 single sculls event Amelia Moule finished second in the third heat in a time of 4.12, taking her through to the repechage. After a good, solid scull she won the race well ahead of her opposition to gain a place in the final. The opposition crews from St. Ives, Durham School and Isle of Ely were very strong but the Sudbury sculler had a superb race with the final result showing a second place finish in a very fast time of 4.02.6, only 0.6 of a second behind the Junior GB sculler from Isle of Ely.

Paul Adams, Tim Hysom, Stephen Nichols, Helen Sharp (cox), Terry Gostling (coach) and Lee Adams.

Last weekend saw a great performance from a very young J18 quad at the high profile junior event, National Schools Regatta at Dorney Lake.

Amelia Maskell, Martha Bullen and Amelia Moule were joined by Helena Griffiths when a hamstring injury meant that Freya Evans had to withdraw from the crew a few days before the race. The crew had to complete a time trial over a 1750 metre course where only 18 of the 39 crews would proceed to the 2000 metre finals.

The Sudbury crew completed the trial in a time of 6.41 securing a place in the C final where some very spirited sculling and determination saw them overcome a local rival crew from Kings School Ely, Cambridgeshire in the last few strokes, in a time of 7.44, to finish 16th in the country.
