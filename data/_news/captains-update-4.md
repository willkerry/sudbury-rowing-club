## Introduction

Another rowing year has ended with the recent AGM and a new one is now under way. This newsletter is to keep you up to date with what is happening at the club as well as our plans for the next few weeks.

## Vice Captains

Firstly though a big thanks to Katherine Cass and Sam Hogsbjerg who were VCs last year and decided not to stand for re-election. They have both contributed a huge amount to the club and I am sure will continue to do so.

The new Vice Captains are:

- Tim Hysom – Mens Squad
- Tricia McGrillen - Ladies Squad
- Rob Frost – Junior Squad
- Pippa Kerry – LTR and Development Squad

It will make their task much easier if you can let them know your availability for training and events in good time. If you have any queries or issues about rowing matters please speak to your VC or anyone on the Rowing Committee

## Rowing Committee

The Rowing Committee meets monthly and comprises the VCs plus:

- Mike Arnott – Coaches
- Ellie Adams – Coxes
- John Bowles – Boat Maintenance
- Ella Hysom, Molly Shaw – Juniors

We have the responsibility for all things rowing including boat purchases and maintenance, training planning and organisation and club attendance at events.

We have recently purchased a new heavyweight single which will mean that some of our taller members will find sculling a little easier. We are planning to purchase a heavyweight 4+ in the coming months and we have also applied for a British Rowing grant which will help to part fund some more singles and doubles aimed for use by LTR and novice members. Also on our list are some more sweep and sculling blades.

We are seeking for more members to attend coaching events. If you are interested in formalising your coaching skills please contact a VC. We are able to provide support to cover costs.

## New Members

A very warm welcome to all of our new experienced and LTR members who have joined in recent weeks. I hope you all feel part of the club and know you can ask if you are not sure about anything.

We had very successful evening when 26 new members attended a recent capsize drill at Sudbury Kingfisher. Everyone who attended was successful. We are planning another session in February for those who have not yet completed the drill.

## GB Trials

After success at the J18 Category of the Scullers Head which Katherine Insull won with her teammate from Lea Rowing Club Maddie Badcott she attended the National Junior Trials. Katherine came 9th in the selection and will be asked to go to further trials and is well placed for selection.

Sophie Brown also went for trials for the GB Adaptive Squad and will be asked back for the next one planned in April.

Well done Katherine and Sophie.

## Recent Events

### Norfolk Scullers Head

We attended the head on a cold and windy day with Tom Bowles and Ellie Adams representing the Juniors in singles and Pippa Kerry and Jeremy Milbank and Hannah Lodge and Keith Paxman in Masters Doubles.

Tom performed really well and Ellie won her event. The doubles were the only entries in their category although Pippa and Jeremy were clear winners between the two SRC boats.

### Star Head

We came back from Star Head after a pleasant day in the autumn sun with 7 wins – a great day for the club.

Congratulations to:

- J15 1x – Ellie
- Mas 2x – Pippa Kerry and Jeremy Milbank
- J15 2x – Ellie Adams and Amy Bowles
- J16 2x - Molly Shaw and Amy Bland (Rob Roy)
- J17 4+ - Toby Stock, Tom Bowles, Alex Blackman, Will Kerry and Holly Adams (cox)
- MAS 4+ - Dave Bull, Tim Hysom, John Bowles, Austin Shaw and Ella Hysom (cox)
- Mas 8+ - Dave Bull, Tim Hysom, John Bowles, Austin Shaw, Paul Adams, Graham Morris, Simon Coll, Keith Paxman and Mike Arnott (cox)

## Coming Events

### Ardleigh Head

We have a number of crews going to the Ardleigh Head on 8 December. This is event is being organised by our colleagues at Essex University and I am pleased we are able to support them this year.

## Pudding Races

Our annual Pudding Races will be on 22 December this year. It’s our traditional mix of scratch racing and pre Christmas social. Look out for more details soon.
