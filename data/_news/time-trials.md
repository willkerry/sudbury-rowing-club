Regular training on the River took on a slightly different flavour this weekend, with the first of the season's time trials being staged on Saturday. These are run to foster the competitive element within the club, to give a positive start to winter training, and to offer video/coaching opportunities under race conditions. Spread over 5 divisions, a total of 31 Sudbury members took part in the day, in mix & match combinations of 21 crews, with the club also paying host and offering the same coaching facilities to a further 4 crews from Beccles Rowing Club.
