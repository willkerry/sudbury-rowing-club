The Junior Squad from Sudbury Rowing Club was represented by two crews at the Schools Head of the River Race on the Thames.

The race, which covers 4 1/4 miles from Putney to Mortlake, is the same course as the Oxford/Cambridge Boat Race and competitors came from all over the UK as well as Ireland and Italy.

As well as Club crews, many crews represented schools and colleges where rowing is part of the curriculum. There were nearly four hundred crews competing in eights, fours and quads, all having to contend with very wet conditions. The fast flowing stream on the Thames is always challenging and steering the best course, staying in the fastest stream can prove tricky, especially for coxless crews.

The boys crew from Sudbury Rowing Club raced in the Championship Coxless Quads event. The crew of Sam McLoughlin (stroke), Byron Bullen, Henry Tullin and Gareth Moriarty (bow) had twenty seven crews in their category and they finished 24th in a time of 19 minutes and 55 seconds. The winner of their category was Maidenhead RC in a time of 17.19.

The girls crew of Amelia Moule (stroke), Freya Evans, Amelia Maskell and Martha Bullen (bow) raced in the Girls Championship Coxless Quads event, where they finished 15th out of 23 crews in a time of 20 minutes 46 seconds. The winner of their category was Latymer Upper School in a time of 19.17.

Both the Sudbury crews gained valuable experience and raced well, especially as they were competing up at least one age category, and therefore will be able to race in the same events next year.

The next event for Sudbury Rowing Club will be the Easter Opening on Good Friday.

This traditional event marks the opening of the rowing regatta season, and the transition from long distance head racing to regatta racing.

Scratch crews take part in short races from 11.00am and spectators are welcome on Friars Meadow to cheer on the crews. Following the fun and frantic racing, it's back to the clubhouse for refreshments and the formal opening with the Mayor raising the club flag at about 1.00pm.

Anyone who is considering returning to rowing after a break, or perhaps is new to the area and is looking for a rowing club to join, this is a good opportunity to have a look around and chat to members.
