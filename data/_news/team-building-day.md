'I can't thank all the members of Sudbury Rowing Club who made our corporate rowing experience so special. Giving people the opportunity to try out rowing for the very first time is something important to me, I'm passionate about the sport and want everyone's first experience on the river to be wonderful. Sudbury Rowing Club made this happen. Thank you for your tireless work and infectious enthusiasm, I will be sure to recommend you in the future.' - Alex Gregory MBE. 2 x Olympic Gold Medalist.
