After the success of the Sudbury Regatta last weekend, members of Sudbury Rowing Club were keen to increase their wins at the Peterborough Summer Regatta.

The first day of the two day event was over 1000 metres on the four lane course. Crews included men's IM2 coxless four, men's masters double scull, men's IM3 coxless pair, junior 14 single sculler, and junior 18 single sculls (Moriarty and Power). No success on the first day of racing but on day 2 the course was shortened to 500 metres which makes for faster and often very exciting racing.

The mens IM2 coxless four of George Cook, Alex Blackman, Keiron Dibley and Tom Bowles finished second in their final. Men's novice double scull of Josh Spence and James Clune-Clarkson finished third in their heat. Sudbury's adaptive rower Sophie Brown came third in her final. Womens IM3 double scull of Jen Titterington and Claire Wells finished fourth in their final.

Men's junior 18 single sculler Morgan Moriarty raced in the same category as Callum Power. They raced in different heats and although both finishing in a time of 1.51, Power finished in third place in his heat, and therefore did not go through to the next round. Moriarty however finished in second place in his heat earning a place in the repechage where he had a good race finishing third. Men's IM3 double sculls Moriarty and Callum Power finished second in their heat to gain a place in the repechage. An excellent race the Sudbury crew narrowly missed out on a place in the final by half a second!

Womens IM3 quad of Nell Belcher, Julia van Zyl, Natasha Treagust and Amelia Moule had a very close race in the heat where they finished in second place, one second behind Nottingham, earning a place in the final. Again the final was very close and the Nottingham crew proved too strong, Sudbury again one second behind them in second place. Doubling up in the Womens junior 16 double sculls Natasha Treagust and Amelia Moule were fastest over the two heats, followed by a Nottingham/Globe crew, both earning places in the final. Sudbury had an even quicker final, but this time were beaten by the Nottingham/Globe composite crew by 2 seconds.

Junior 14 single sculler Sam McLoughlin finished second in his final. After a good start he went on to lead the race right up until he clipped a buoy about twenty strokes from the finish which put him off his stride and he lost out by half a second.

The three wins of the day all came from veteran crews. The first being the men's masters C/D coxed four. After big birthday celebrations the night before, Keith Paxman teamed up with Lee Adams, Paul Adams, Robin King and Helen Sharp (cox) to finish first in the final, King's first win for thirty years!

The Womens novice eight of Maria Vigneau, Sharon Wright, Angela Colclough, Sophie Lovegrove, Clair Wells, Asha Thobhani, Vickie Hayton, Catherine Smith and Natasha Treagust (cox) raced well in the final finishing in first place. Half of the crew won in the novice quad sculls at the Sudbury regatta last week. The other half of the crew went on to race in the Womens masters novice coxed four event. Maria Vigneau, Sharon Wright, Angela Colclough, Sophie Lovegrove and Helen Sharp (cox) went on to take their second win of the day.

Another successful event for Sudbury Rowing Club, now looking ahead to the Cambridge Autumn Regatta at the beginning of September.
