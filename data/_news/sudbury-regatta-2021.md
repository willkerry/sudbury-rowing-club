The 7th of August 2021 saw the long-awaited return of Sudbury Regatta on Friars Meadow.

Saturday was a fantastic day despite the weather delivering alternating bouts of wind and rain with blazing sunshine and even thunder at one point. Needless to say it gave the rowers some challenging conditions to deal with.

        <p>Once again the meadow filled up with the many visiting clubs, competitors, boats, trailers, tents and spectators.</p> 
        <p>We were privileged that so many fellow rowers wanted to return to competition after over a year at our unique regatta.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Well done to all of our competitors.</p>

<p>After having to cancel the Sudbury Regatta in 2020 due to Covid we were delighted to be able to run this year’s event on Saturday after concerns over recent months that we would be able to go ahead.</p>

<p>Over 250 competitors participated in 166 races on Friars Meadow and the club members turned out in numbers to ensure the whole day went smoothly despite the wind and rain. Thanks are due to all those who volunteered to plan the event and help on the day to make it such a resounding success’.</p>
