The Rowing Foundation, a charity whose aim is to promote the participation in rowing of young and disabled people, recently allocated a grant to Sudbury Rowing Club to purchase new sculling blades for our Junior Squad.

The new Concept sculling blades will make a welcome addition to the club equipment as our junior squad goes from strength to strength with new members joining on a regular basis.

We would like to thank the Rowing Foundation for their generous grant, more details can be found at: [http://www.therowingfoundation.org.uk/](http://www.therowingfoundation.org.uk/)
